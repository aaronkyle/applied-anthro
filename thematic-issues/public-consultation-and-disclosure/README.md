Companies seeking international financing must commit to an ongoing consultation engagement process that extends throughout the life of the project.

Consultation and engagement efforts encompasses a broad range of activities and approaches—from information sharing and consultation to negotiation, participatory decision-making, and partnerships—to ensure that a project and its operators maintain their social license to operate.

## IFC Context



## PS1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management System

Among other issues, Performance Standard 1 establishes the importance of effective community engagement through disclosure of project-related information and consultation with local communities on matters that directly affect them. Community engagement is defined as “an on-going process involving the client’s disclosure of information… free of external manipulation, interference, or coercion, and intimidation, and conducted on the basis of timely, relevant, understandable and accessible information”. The purpose such engagement is “to build and maintain over time a constructive relationship with these communities”. The nature and frequency of community engagement must reflect the project’s risks to and adverse impacts on the affected communities. 

IFC articulates three general topics within the framework of community engagement: disclosure, consultation and grievance mechanisms.

**Disclosure**

IFC requires that clients publicly disclose the Assessment document. If communities face potential risks or adverse impacts from the project, clients must provide such communities with access to information on the purpose, nature and scale of the project, the duration of proposed project activities, and the nature of such potential risks and impacts. Disclosure should occur early in the Social and Environmental Assessment process and in any event before the project construction commences; disclosure must also be continued on an ongoing basis.

**Consultation**

If affected communities may be subject to risks or adverse impacts from a project, IFC requires that clients undertake a process of consultation in a manner that provides the affected communities with opportunities to express their views on project risks, impacts, and mitigation measures. Such consultation should also allow the client to consider and respond to community inputs. Effective consultation:
* (i)	should be based on the prior disclosure of relevant and adequate information, including draft documents and plans
* (ii)	should begin early in the Social and Environmental Assessment process
* (iii)	must focus on the social and environmental risks and adverse impacts, and the proposed measures and actions to address these
* (iv)	must be carried out on an ongoing basis as risks and impacts arise. 

Consultation must be undertaken in a manner that is inclusive and culturally appropriate—tailoring the consultation process to the language preferences and decision-making process of the affected communities and to the needs of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups.

For projects with significant adverse impacts on affected communities, consultation must ensure their free, prior and informed consultation and facilitate their informed participation. Informed participation involves organised and iterative consultation, leading to the client’s incorporating into their decision-making process the views of the affected communities on matters that affect them directly (such as proposed mitigation measures, the sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues). The consultation must be documented—particularly the measures taken to avoid or minimise risks to and adverse impacts on the affected communities.

**Grievance Mechanism**

IFC mandates that clients respond to communities’ concerns. If anticipating ongoing risks to or adverse impacts on affected communities, the client must establish a grievance mechanism to receive and facilitate resolution of communities’ concerns and grievances. The grievance mechanism should be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the project. It should address concerns promptly using an understandable and transparent process that is culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the affected communities—at no cost and without retribution. The mechanism should not impede access to judicial or administrative remedies.
The client must inform the affected communities about the project grievance mechanism in the course of its community engagement process.

**Reporting**

In terms of external reporting, IFC requires clients to disclose to affected communities an Action Plan describing specific mitigation measures and actions necessary for the project to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of the Performance Standards. Clients must also provide periodic reports that describe progress with Action Plan implementation on issues that involve ongoing risk to or impacts on affected communities, and on issues of concern identified via the consultation process or grievance mechanism. These reports must also be in a format accessible to the affected communities and in a frequency proportionate to the concerns of affected communities (but not less than annually).


## PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions

Performance Standard 2 requires consultation to be carried out in cases where large-scale retrenchment is necessary (e.g. at the end of the project operation phase). In these cases, the client must ensure consultation with employees, their representative organisations and the government (where appropriate) in a manner that is absent of discrimination.
IFC PS 2 also stipulates the need for a grievance mechanism for workers (and their organisations, where they exist) to raise reasonable workplace concerns. This mechanism should involve an appropriate level of management and address concerns promptly, using an understandable and transparent process that provides feedback to those concerned, without any retribution. The mechanism should not impede access to other judicial or administrative remedies that might be available under law or through existing arbitration procedures, or substitute for grievance mechanisms provided through collective agreements. IFC obligates clients to inform their workforce of the grievance mechanism at the time of hire, and make it easily accessible to them.


## PS 3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement

Performance Standard 3 does not contain any specific provisions calling for community consultation/participation, disclosure, or grievance redrerdss


## PS 4: Community Health Safety and Security

Performance Standard 4 does not contain any specific provisions calling for community consultation/participation, disclosure, or grievance redress


## PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement

Performance Standard 5 also makes clear statements requiring consultation evidencing the informed participation of affected persons and communities in decision-making processes. It stipulates that consultation “will continue during the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of compensation payment and resettlement”. 

For instances of physical displacement, consultations must help clients to offer displaced persons choices among feasible resettlement options, and provide relocation assistance suited to the needs of each group of displaced persons—with particular attention to the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. Consultations are also necessary to inform clients’ determinations of relocation assistance that suffice to restore the standards of living of affected people and communities.

IFC also mandates that clients establish special grievance mechanisms for receive and addresses concerns specific to compensation and relocation.


## PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management


For Performance Standard 6, the need for community consultation is understood as integral to defining an appropriate system of independent certification for the sustainable management of the resources.


## PS 7: Indigenous Peoples

Information disclosure, consultation and informed participation are key issues in IFC Performance Standard 7. When a project initiative will affect communities of Indigenous Peoples, the Client is to establish an ongoing relationship from as early as possible in the project planning and to maintain it throughout the life of the project. In projects with adverse impacts, the consultation process will ensure the free, prior, and informed consultation on affected communities of Indigenous Peoples and facilitate their informed participation on matters that affect them directly. Processes of community engagement must be culturally appropriate and commensurate with the risks and potential impacts to the Indigenous Peoples.

To ensure these aims, IFC mandates the following steps:
* involve Indigenous Peoples’ representative bodies (e.g. councils of elders or village councils, etc.)
* be inclusive of both women and men and of various age groups in a culturally appropriate manner
* provide sufficient time for Indigenous Peoples’ collective decision-making processes
* facilitate the Indigenous Peoples’ expression of their views, concerns, and proposals in the language of their choice, without external manipulation, interference, or coercion, and without intimidation
* ensure that the grievance mechanism is culturally appropriate and accessible for Indigenous Peoples

For projects affecting communities of Indigenous Peoples, IFC also requires clients to “seek to identify, through the process of free, prior, and informed consultation with and the informed participation of the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples, opportunities for culturally appropriate development benefits.” Such opportunities and benefits should be commensurate with the degree of project impacts, with the aim of improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to fostering the long-term sustainability of the natural resource on which Indigenous Peoples communities. The client must document identified development benefits and make them accessible to Indigenous Peoples communities in a timely and equitable manner.


## PS 8:	Cultural Heritage

Performance Standard 8 states that where a project may affect cultural heritage, clients must consult with affected communities who use, or have used within living memory, the cultural heritage for longstanding cultural purposes and must incorporate the views of the affected communities on such cultural heritage into the client’s decision-making process. Consultation will also involve the relevant national or local regulatory agencies that are entrusted with the protection of cultural heritage.&nbsp;
