## Implementation Notes & Guides

IFIs produce a number of helpful informational resources to assist in project design and implementation.

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/thematic-issues/ifi-implementation-resources) collects informational resources produced by financial institutions.

* [`implementation-resources_adb`](implementation-resources_adb.html) \*
* [`implementation-resources_ifc`](implementation-resources_ifc.md)
* [`implementation-resources_world_bank`](implementation-resources_world-bank.html)\*

ADB and World Bank pages rendered differently for legacy purposes.

My early logic is separating out resources by institution for this link lists is that I am often interested in how an institution informs its staff to interpret or implement a policy.

Additional examples and resources from international practice:
* [implementation-resources_external-standards-and-guidelines](implementation-resources_external-standards-and-guidelines.md)
