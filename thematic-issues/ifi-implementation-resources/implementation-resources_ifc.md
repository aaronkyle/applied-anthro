## Cellulose-from-straw production opportunities in Ukraine
This report estimates that only 30 percent of the domestic demand for paper and cardboard is satisfied by production in Ukraine. As a result, Ukraine must import about one million tons of paper (newsprint, offset, and coated). The main barrier to boosting domestic production and expanding the product line is a lack of feed stock available needed for the manufacturing process. Straw, now widely used in paper manufacturing globally, is under used in Ukraine.

## Belarus Food Safety: Improving standards to enhance competitiveness
Belarus has a vibrant food industry currently characterized by excess production and processing capacity. At the same time, only a small number of the 800 food processing companies have internationally compliant food safety management systems in place. If brought in line with international food safety and quality standards, the Belarusian food industry could experience significant export market growth. IFC is working with Belarusian food producers to help them adopt better food safety procedures and standards and increase their competitiveness.

IFC works with financial institutions to introduce environmental, social, and governance standards, as well as risk management to their lending practices. We also work to promote stability of financial systems in developing countries, and channel finance to responsible companies.

In addition, we work with regulators and stock exchanges to introduce environmental, social and governance standards to markets—which can help address challenges that are beyond the ability or responsibility of a company to solve alone.

### The Equator Principles

IFC has played a pivotal role in establishing and updating the Equator Principles—a sustainability framework that has become the standard for environmental and social principles throughout the financial industry. We supported the drafting and implementation of the framework and since then have provided training, guidance, and advice to implementing banks. Today 84 financial institutions in 35 countries have officially adopted the principles, covering more than 70 percent of international project finance debt in emerging markets.

We also help clients understand and find solutions to difficult challenges they face.

 

##### DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS

IFC systematically seeks feedback from stakeholders. This is critical to our ability to deliver results.

Through regular consultations and partnerships with civil society organizations, the private sector, and others, we form a continuous feedback loop with our stakeholders about key sustainability issues. We receive valuable feedback regarding our work. We believe that over time, this increased—and ongoing—dialogue and partnerships results in better project outcomes, increased awareness on the part of affected communities, and stronger relationships with stakeholders.

##### Transparency and Accountability

Transparency and accountability are central to our approach. They are essential aspects of building and maintaining public dialogue. They help improve project design and contribute to strong development outcomes.

IFC believes that transparency and accountability are fundamental to fulfilling our development mandate and strengthening public trust in IFC and our clients. IFC's [Access to Information Policy](https://disclosures.ifc.org/#/accessInfoPolicy)  reaffirms and reflects our commitment to these principles.

We disclose information about our projects, including project-level environmental and social review summaries (ESRS), through our [disclosure portal](https://disclosures.ifc.org/).

IFC’s work is continuously evaluated by two independent accountability mechanisms:

The [Independent Evaluation Group](http://www.ifc.org/oeg) is charged with evaluating the activities of IBRD and IDA (the World Bank), the work of IFC in private sector development, and MIGA's guarantee projects and services. The goals of evaluation are to provide an objective assessment of the results of the Bank Group’s work and to identify and disseminate lessons learned from experience.

The [Compliance Advisor Ombudsman](http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/) (CAO) is the independent recourse mechanism for IFC and MIGA. The CAO responds to complaints from project-affected communities with the goal of enhancing social and environmental outcomes on the ground.

Stakeholder Engagement: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets provides guidance on consultation and stakeholder engagement for private-sector companies. Although this handbook reiterates IFC requirements for early and sustained community engagement commensurate with project impacts, the focus of the manual is on effective practices.

The Handbook is divided into two parts. Part one, contains the key concepts and principles of stakeholder engagement, the practices that are known to be effective, and the tools to implement them. Topics covered in this section include: stakeholder identification and analysis, consultation with Indigenous People, equal gender representation, informed participation, negotiations, grievance management, disclosure, stakeholder monitoring, and management functions.  Part two shows how these principles, practices, and tools fit with the different phases of the project cycle, from initial concept, through construction and operations, to divestment and/or decommissioning. Essentially this section offers guidance on the best times to commence various stages of the stakeholder engagement process, such as property negations, environmental assessment consultations, the development of grievance management mechanisms, et

Interspersed throughout both sections of this manual are case studies which detail the experiences of various private companies successfully, and unsuccessfully, engaging in stakeholder engagement. One recommendation of particular relevance to the extractive industry, drawn from a case study of Glamis Gold, is that all parties who perceive themselves as stakeholders, including both NGO’s and governments, should be identified and appropriately engaged. Glamis Gold had to temporarily shut down its operations because it did not identify nor engage with parties, living outside of the direct influence of the project, who nevertheless perceived themselves as major stakeholders of the project.&nbsp;

* [Financial Valuation Tool](https://www.fvtool.com/using-the-fv-tool/)

IFC developed the FV Tool to help companies identify the optimum sustainability investment portfolio to deliver maximum business and social value.

Independent research in the extractive sector shows that prudent, local sustainability investments can be critical to ensuring on-time and on-budget project completion in addition to creating community benefits. In a study of 190 oil and gas projects, Goldman Sachs found that over 70% of delays were caused by stakeholder-related sustainability issues, more than commercial or technical factors. Accenture found that 33% of these projects were over budget by 25% or more due to unforeseen delays.

The FV Tool allows an organization to test whether its sustainability initiatives will effectively create or protect value for a project and, most importantly, manage risks that could negatively impact project completion and ongoing business operations. And because it uses a data-driven methodology, Return on Investment is expressed in the quantifiable metric of Net Present Value (NPV), which enables sustainability budgets to more effectively compete with other corporate priorities.
