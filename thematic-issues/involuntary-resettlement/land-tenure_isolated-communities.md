# Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation

## Introduction

There is no universally accepted definition of ‘isolated Indigenous Peoples’, which is illustrated by the wide range of names that have been used for them: ‘uncontacted peoples’, ‘peoples in voluntary isolation’, ‘peoples in relative isolation’, ‘free peoples’, etc. There are also subsets of isolated peoples, like peoples with whom contact has been established by the national society. A general definition of isolated peoples is: “indigenous peoples or segments of indigenous peoples who do not maintain or have or have never had regular contacts with the population outside their own group, and who tend to refuse contact with such outside persons” ([Shelton et al. 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 8). 

In the framework of international law, protecting the rights of isolated indigenous peoples has become a priority of increasing urgency in the recent decades. Significantly, the rights of isolated peoples to their traditionally occupied territories and to strengthen their traditional relationship to such lands and related resources are guaranteed in Articles 25 and 26 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([Colleoni and Proaño 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 180). Similarly, the UN-REDD Programme requires the development of any 'REDD+ programme/activity' to identify Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation in consultation with relevant entities at the national, sub-national and/or local levels prior to any activity ([UN-REDD 2009](http://www.un-redd.org/Portals/15/documents/events/20090309Panama/Documents/UN%20REDD%20IP%20Guidelines%2023Mar09.pdf): 14-15). It also stresses the importance of avoiding contact with such communities, the inappropriateness of seeking contact for the purpose of achieving consent ([Laughlin 2013](http://www.ecosystem-alliance.org/sites/default/files/documents/unredd_fpic_guidelines_working_final.pdf): 22). It is important to stress, however, that 'isolation' does not imply *total* isolation. In fact, many if not most indigenous communities living in voluntary isolation has chosen to do so after encountering mainstream societies ([Castillo 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 71). In some cases, contacted tribes have become ‘wards’ who help facilitate the implementation of protection measures for isolated peoples, such as the Kubu, Baduy and Dayak in Indonesia ([Peerson et al. 2007](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/12427/ED_2007_Persoon_indigenous_peoples_southeast_Asia.pdf?sequence=1): 23).

The farming systems of isolated indigenous communities are usually not settled in one place, but cover an extensive area on a rotational basis. Isolated peoples also often cover their tracks carefully to avoid contact. Projects that can potentially affect isolated Indigenous Peoples therefore need to perform careful analysis of their presence and avoid operations in their territories ([Amazon Watch 2011](http://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/fpic-the-right-to-decide.pdf): 7).

The wellbeing of isolated Indigenous Peoples is inextricably linked to the natural balance of the place they inhabit, and they are highly susceptible to any change in their ecology. Furthermore, the mapping of the territories of isolated peoples varies immensely between nations. Project activities in areas that appear vacant can therefore severely impact isolated communities’ ability to hunt, fish, or access clean water ([Amazon Watch 2011](http://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/fpic-the-right-to-decide.pdf): 2). Considering that isolated peoples are also more directly vulnerable to these impacts than other non-sedentary groups of Indigenous Peoples, project operators need to be acutely aware of these challenges.


## Common Challenges and Threats to Indigenous Peoples in Voluntary Isolation

A common challenge in engagement with Indigenous Peoples is the difference in perception of land rights. In the case of isolated Indigenous Peoples, such as the forest peoples of South America, this challenge is greatly exacerbated by the inadvisability of contact. An associated challenge is the potential (and often real) inaccuracies in government data on isolated peoples. For example, an area shown by a government-made map to be empty could be an important hunting or fishing site at some distance to the community ([Amazon Watch 2011](http://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/fpic-the-right-to-decide.pdf): 6).

The greatest threats faced by isolated communities are overwhelmingly related to their health. As a consequence of their limited contact with the outside world, members of isolated communities lack immunities to a wide range of diseases that are easily transmitted by encroachers. All kinds of encroachers – illegal loggers, tradesmen, peasant settlers, missionaries, academics, tourists, adventurers, etc. – will bring foreign agents into isolated communities if contact is made. A major challenge, therefore, is to effectively protect such communities from encroachers, and to establish contingency plans for cases where contact is unavoidable ([Vaz 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 46). As the health of isolated communities is intrinsically linked to a balanced environment, they are particularly vulnerable to environmental impacts arising from development activities even in areas they do not inhabit or visit regularly. Hence, project operators are expected to do their utmost to monitor, avoid and mitigate such impacts without disturbing the lifeways of the communities.

Another major threat to isolated peoples is insufficient state protection of their rights, the integrity of their territory, and their health and well-being. A common protection measure is for national governments to establish protected areas or reserves, but in practice these boundaries are often not fully respected ([Shelton et al.](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 8). This problem is made worse by the fact that isolated peoples cannot advocate for their own rights ([Vaz 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 16). The issue of state protection of has been receiving increasing attention in international discourse in recent years. For example, in 2013, the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (AIDESEP) criticized the Peruvian state for failing to establish protection mechanisms for the Kugapakori, Nahua, Nanti and other peoples (RTKNN) in the regions of Cusco and Ucayali ([AIDESEP 2013](http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2013/10/AIDESEPStatementRTKNNOct2013.pdf)). The Peruvian state has also been accused of failing to address the serious challenges for isolated peoples, which are often a matter of life and death ([Castillo 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 56). In Bolivia, it has been alleged that non-compliance with laws is facilitated loopholes and vague language ([Camacho Nassar 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 96). Another example is Venezuela, where the state maintains that ‘isolated communities’ or ‘peoples in voluntary isolation’ do not exist. Instead, Venezuela has communities with which contact have recently been established, or in ‘relative isolation’ or ‘initial contact’. To some extent, this has been found to be true in Venezuela. However, it has been found that some groups *within* communities in relative isolation have opted to live in isolation.([Bello 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 130). Such groups are not recognized by Venezuela’s Ministry of Indigenous Peoples (established in 2007), however, as the Ministry argues that such groups have already been integrated into national society ([Bello 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 153). As this shows, it is crucial for projects and activities likely to affect isolated peoples (regardless of status) to know the specific context of such peoples in the country in question.

Language barriers often hamper effective protection of isolated peoples. In many cases, both historically and in recent history, such communities have been forced to learn the national language to communicate with state workers. It is important that all communication with isolated communities (if communication is necessary or cannot be avoided) be conducted in their native language. The challenge, therefore, is for relevant actors to promote the learning of the indigenous language by everyone working with such peoples, for instance by establishing cooperation agreements with academic centres ([Vaz 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 46).


## Case Examples

Some approaches have been hailed as successful and well-designed with regard to the protection of isolated peoples. The ‘Forest Investment Plan for Peru’ developed by AIDESEP and Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas (CONAP), under the heading of Climate Investment Funds, is one such approach. Developed in consultation with indigenous representatives, it aims to fund projects promoting the protection of Peru’s rainforests and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contains specific provisions for isolated peoples. For example, the framework prioritizes strengthening the capacity to prevent and limit illegal land seizures and logging, and one of the strategies supported by the framework concerns monitoring territories occupied by isolated peoples to limit encroachment ([AIDESEP and CONAP 2013](http://www.claveverde.org/attachments/article/396/FIP_english.pd.pdf): 86).

A highly publicized project that has received criticism for its impacts to isolated peoples is the [Camisea Gas Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camisea_Gas_Project) in Peru, operated by a consortium led by Pluspetrol. The project has being accused of threatening the survival of Indigenous Peoples living in voluntary isolation in the Kugapakori-Nahua-Nanti and Others’ Reserve in the southeast Peruvian Amazon ([Feather 2014](http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2014/01/camisea-englishlowres_0.pdf): 1). The reserve, comprising 443,887 hectares, was created in 1990 by the Peruvian government, with the stated aim of protecting the land rights of the area’s native groups living in isolation. President Alejandro Toledo upgraded the legal status of the reserve in 2003 through a Supreme Decree, prohibiting the establishment of settlements and economic development and activities different from the settlements and activities of the reserve inhabitants ([Feather 2014](http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2014/01/camisea-englishlowres_0.pdf): 5). In spite of this legal protection, the lot granted to the Camisea by the Peruvian government overlaps the reserve by 23% ([Feather 2014](http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2014/01/camisea-englishlowres_0.pdf): 6). Project activities have consequently caused significant impacts to the people living in the reserves, such as declines in the size and health in fish populations and health impacts. In spite of this, as of 2011, the operating companies completed no comprehensive baseline study, nor did it implement monitoring of the community ([Castro de la Mata et al. 2011](http://www.southperupanel.org/pdf/SouthPeruPanel2012.pdf): 32). As a result of all this, the project has been heavily criticized in the media, making the Camisea project highly illustrative of the costs project operators can suffer when they operate on or near land utilized by people living in voluntary isolation.

As the situation in Peru illustrates, lacking implementation of policy is a common problem for projects likely to impact isolated peoples. Project operators are especially reliant on host governments for reliable information when it comes to isolated communities, making this a serious challenge to be aware of. The formulation of protective policies themselves, however, has gradually improved in many nations. For example, in the late 1980s, Brazil changed its legal paradigm for interventions into indigenous life from being based on ‘contact’ to being sensitive to communities avoiding contact. More importantly, the state’s role was changed from being a guarantor of the rights of individuals to the rights of peoples ([Vaz 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 13). This change also established a process of verification for all information collected from informants and fieldwork ([Vaz 2013](http://www.iwgia.org/iwgia_files_publications_files/0617_Indigenous_peoplesAISLADOS.pdf): 17). This process could be useful for projects to emulate; at any rate, it underscores the need for all project activities to be designed and implemented based on verified and comprehensive information. The investment program received approval from the Forest Investment Program Sub-Committee on October 30, 2013, and a total of US$50 million will be granted to projects that reduce logging and greenhouse gas emissions in Peru ([Bank Information Center 2013](http://www.bicusa.org/approval-of-50-million-forest-investment-plan-for-peru-with-key-indigenous-and-community-involvement/)). The specific provisions on isolated peoples in this fund and the priorities of the projects it supports illustrate the need to maintain appropriate distance from the isolated community in implementing measures to improve their protection. It also targets and takes into consideration one of the key factors in the well-being of isolated peoples, namely a balanced environment. 


## Elements of Good Practice

More than anything else, project operators should do their utmost to avoid operations on land contiguous to or overlapping the territories of isolated indigenous communities. As the above discussion shows, however, mapping the exact location of such territories is a matter fraught with both inaccuracy and controversy. It is therefore crucial for project operators to identify relevant agencies, NGOs and other organizations early on to collaborate with in identifying the territories of isolated communities.

It is also important to note that day-to-day operations for projects impacting isolated communities have to be informed by supreme sensitivity with regard to their territories. As the implementation of policies to protect indigenous lands is often found to be lacking, private sector actors should take the lead in ensuring the continued protection thereof. Regularly informing and updating every operating instance concerning the approximate boundaries of affected communities living in voluntary isolation is crucial to the mitigation of impacts. Projects should also be prepared for any instance of accidental contact or contact sought from the communities themselves.

Further adding to the controversy likely to surround any project impacting peoples in voluntary isolation is the general inadvisability of direct social investment. While the livelihoods of nomadic and transhumance communities can be improved in a variety of ways, such interventions are extremely difficult with isolated peoples without establishing contact. Working with people that do have contact with the communities in question, such as so called ‘ward’ communities that have already established contact with mainstream society, is one of very few entry points for interventions and data-gathering.
