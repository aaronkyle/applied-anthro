## Archives

The [archives folder](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/archive) is a collection of HTML docs that once constituted [the front end website](http://applied-anthro.com) for this project.

At the time I started the project, I was (and I continue) learning about [Python](https://www.python.org/). To aid my learning, I started building the site using the python-powered static site generator, [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/).

substantially improved durign the measure of time with which I hosted the site through Pelican.

[GitHub's Jekyll integration ](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) now converts all markdown pages written to one's [`gh-pages` branch](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) automatically through an execution of code that 'builds' (generates) the site and serves it publicly.

Rather than continuing with Pelican, I started instead to re-deploy this site using GitHub's Jekyll environment and using supported themes.

Given that GitHub's Jekyll is now operating directly out of my [main repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/), I don't expect too much activity in this folder going forward. I am not sure if and why I will keep the contents of this folder. Can there be sentamentality in nostalgia?
