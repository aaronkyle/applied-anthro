## Implementation Notes & Guides

IFIs produce a number of helpful informational resources to assist in project design and implementation.

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/thematic-issues/ifi-implementation-resources) collects informational resources produced by financial institutions.

* [`implementation-resources_adb`](implementation-resources_adb.html) \*
* [`implementation-resources_ifc`](implementation-resources_ifc.md)
* [`implementation-resources_world_bank`](implementation-resources_world-bank.html)\*


ADB and World Bank pages rendered differently between GitHub and this site's front end for legacy purposes.

My early logic is separating out resources by institution for this link lists is that I am often interested in how an institution informs its staff to interpret or implement a policy.


Additional examples and resources from international practice:
* [implementation-resources_external-standards-and-guidelines](implementation-resources_external-standards-and-guidelines.md)

This repository collects informational resources by financial institution.  Pages are also rendered in HTML for better viewing.  Althouhgh I rarely update the front end (making it far behind this repositry).

For those viewing via GitHub, click through to view [ADB resources](./implementation-resources_adb.md) and [World Bank resources](./implementation-resources_world-bank.md).
