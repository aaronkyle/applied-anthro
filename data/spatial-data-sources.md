    - ArcticDEM is an NGA-NSF public-private initiative to automatically produce a high-resolution, high quality, digital surface model (DSM) of the Arctic using optical stereo imagery, high-performance computing, and open source photogrammetry software.

* [Arctic Spatial Data Infrastructure Geoportal](http://geoportal.arctic-sdi.org/)
    - The Arctic SDI Geoportal provides a web map viewer for interested users to access the Reference Web Map Service covering the Arctic Region and its Metadata Catalogue
Service.

* [ARCUS - GIS Data](http://archive.arcus.org/gis/maps-data/)
    - This site is from the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States based in Fairbanks, Alaska.

* [Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA)](http://www.gina.alaska.edu/data)
    - GINA is dedicated to images and data for Alaska and surrounding cold regions. This includes SwathViewer which lets you create maps interactively.

* [GIS Data & Resources at the National Snow & Ice Data Center](http://nsidc.org/data/gis/index.html)
    - The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is developing a repository of geographic information systems (GIS)-compatible snow, ice, and frozen ground data for research and planning.

* [International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/arctic/downloads.html)
    - The goal of this initiative is to develop a digital data base that contains all available bathymetric data north of 64Â° North, for use by mapmakers, researchers, institutions, and others whose work requires a detailed and accurate knowledge of the depth and the shape of the Arctic seabed.

* [NGA Arctic Open Data](http://arctic.nga.opendata.arcgis.com/)
    - This is their Open Data Application where publicly released data and services can be discovered, viewed, and downloaded in a variety of formats.

## ANTARCTICA

* [Antarctic Digital Database](http://www.scar.org/)
