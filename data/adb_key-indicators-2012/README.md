The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2019, the 50th edition of this series, presents the latest statistics on a comprehensive set of economic, financial, social, environmental, and SDG indicators for the 49 regional members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It is designed to serve as a resource for information on development issues across the region for a wide audience, including policy makers, development practitioners, government officials, researchers, students, and the general public. The new [Key Indicators Database](https://kidb.adb.org/kidb/) allows interactivity with the data in a user-friendly manner. The database’s advanced functionality includes a categorized search facility for data, various download options, and customized data visualization.

This year’s Key Indicators publication is accompanied by a special supplement focusing on [The CAPI Effect: Boosting Survey Data through Mobile Technology](https://www.adb.org/publications/capi-survey-data-mobile-technology). It discusses the role computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) can play in transforming survey data collection to allow better monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals.
