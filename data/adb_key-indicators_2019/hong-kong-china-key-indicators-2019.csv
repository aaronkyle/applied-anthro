For earlier periods, the CPIs were compiled based on old weights and have been rescaled to the new base period for linking with the new index series. In deriving the year-on-year rates of change, indices of more than one decimal place are used in the calculation. The year-on-year rates of change before October 2015 were derived using the index series in the base periods at that time (for instance the 2009/10-based index series), compared with the index a year earlier in the same base period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the financial nonreserve assets, increases in net financial assets and net financial liabilities are shown with positive signs, and net transactions are computed by subtracting the liabilities from the assets. Thus, a positive value in the net transactions represents a net lending, while a negative value represents a net borrowing. For the overall balance of payments, a positive value represents a surplus, whereas a negative value represents a deficit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
