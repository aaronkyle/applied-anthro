## Data

Social indicator data are rarely done well.  

As a social development practitioner, I've found it difficult to get my head around what 'good' data are all about: how to find and capture, store, sort, and analyze them

Within this folder, I am in the early stages of work to constitute 'social indicator data' that are 'of interest' to various institutions internationally.

A couple of notes about the few files and pages here:

```
social-indicator-data-sources.md

adb_millennium-development-goals
adb_socail-environmental


WDI_2014_IDN filter results.xlsx
IDN_census-survey



```


Please reach out to me if you are interested in this work! I would like to enjoin more people in discussion around the concept of 'social indicator data'.
