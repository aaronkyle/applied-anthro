## Purpose

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development) is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy has varied articulations and manifestations. This repository collates information on how social policy has been articulated across [international financial institutions](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/ifi/) (aka 'development financial institutions') and seeks to track changes in policy articulations over time and across institution. This is a difficult and endless endeavor: policy formulations change and evolve and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive. I do my best to keep up with the changes and to identify and analyze inconsistence where I encounter them.  [I doubt I will ever finish](./disclaimer.md).

I hope that someone other than myself may eventually find this resource, and that my work might help others to analyse social policy and to better appreciate (and document) the nuanced inter-connectedness of [phenomena](#).  If you find your way here, welcome!  If you see spot anything that you'd like to challenge, change, or correct, please send me an email (or better, a submit a pull request). I'd love to hear from you :)
