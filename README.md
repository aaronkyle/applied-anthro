## Purpose

This repository is intended for people interested in social policy. It can be difficult toi understand how different manifestations of social policy are articulated and how these articulations relate to one another&mdash;both within and across institutions.

## Caveats and Disclaimers

Please accept my work as on-going. I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy' for a given lending institution.

Please also recognize that this list is not meant to be exhaustive; my focus is specific to social development concerns.
