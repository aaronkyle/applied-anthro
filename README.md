## Purpose

This repository is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy is articulated and manifested in a variety of forms.  Tracking these articulations over time and across institutions is difficult.  Policy formulations change and evolve, and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive.

This is my attempt to organize and contextualize different manifestations of social policy in relationship to one another.  I hope that others might also be able to use this resource to more readily compare and comprehend manifestations of international social policy and to appreciate their inter-connectedness and their nuance.  

## Caveats and Disclaimers

Please recognize that this is an on-going effort. Attempting to create a organizational framework for the ever-expanding and ever more complex universe of social policy requires considerable time and effort, which I contribute in the hours when I am not [otherwise engaged](http://social-policy.expert). I consider no page to be "complete". Most are still very immature in terms of their content. Most pages contain typos. This will be a life-long project for me. If you see spot anything that you'd like to challenge or correct, please sent me an email (or better, a pull request).

Please also recognize that my work focuses on social development concerns. As I formulate definitions for various terms, I do so with respect to their usage relative to the practice of social development.

<!--
I should also emphasise how much I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy'.
