## Purpose

This repository is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy is articulated and manifested in a variety of forms.  Tracking these articulations over time and across institutions is difficult.  Policy formulations change and evolve, and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive.

This is my attempt to organize and contextualize different manifestations of social policy in relationship to one another.  I hope that others might also be able to use this resource to more readily compare and comprehend manifestations of international social policy and to appreciate their inter-connectedness and their nuance.  

## Caveats and Disclaimers

Please accept my work as an on-going effort.  This undertaking involves a significant amount of time and effort, which I contribute in the hours when I am not otherwise [working to sustain myself](http://aaron-kyle.com). Many sections are incomplete, and the overall effort itself I envision as a life-long project.

Please also recognize that the focus of my work is specific to social development concerns. As I formulate definitions for various terms, I do so with respect to their usage relative to the practice of social development.

<!--
I should also emphasise how much I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy'.
