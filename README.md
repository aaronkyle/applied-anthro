## Purpose

Social policy has varied articulations and manifestations. This repository collates information on how social policy has been articulated by [international financial institutions](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/ifi/) ('development financial institutions') over time and analyses how policy manifests in practice. 

Tracking how social policy is [defined](http://applied-anthro.com/context/) and [realized](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues/) is a difficult and endless endeavor: policy formulations change and evolve and the relationship between seemingly similar [terms](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html) and [concepts](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context) is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive. This repository is [open](./license.md) and [public](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development) in the hope that someone (other than myself) may eventually find and use it. Ideally, this repository may one day help others tasked with analyzing social policy and its [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)) manifestations. 

Currently, I am a solo author&mdash;doing my best to keep up with the changes and to identify and analyze inconsistence where I encounter them. [I doubt I will ever finish](./disclaimer.md). If you find your way here, welcome!  If you'd like to contribute, that'd be amazing. Ideally, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).


## Organization

For those reading [via this site's front end](http://applied-anthro.com/), I am slowing building out navigation links and index files to guide your journey through this website.  For now, you'll find that the site is comprised of '[old](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/)' and 'new' layouts.  This derives from changes I made in how content is generated and published on line.  Please bear with me; I'll work it out.

For those reading [via GitHub](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development), the repository structure will be apparent.  Here's a few bits of orientation.
