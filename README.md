## Purpose

This repository is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy is articulated and manifested in a variety of forms.  Tracking these these articulations over time and across institutions is difficult.  Policy formulations change and evolve, and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometime obtuse and counter-intuitive.

This resource compiles manifestations of social policy attempts to organize and contextualize different manifestations in relation to one another.  My hope is that to be able to facilitate rapid comprehension of the inter-connectedness as well as the differentiated nuances of international social policy.

## Caveats and Disclaimers

Please accept my work as on-going effort.  This undertaking involves a significant amount of time and effort, which I contribute in the hours when I am not otherwise working to sustain myself. Many sections are incomplete, and the overall effort itself I envision as a life-long project.

Please also recognize that the focus of my work is specific to social development concerns. As I formulate definitions for various terms, I do so with respect to their usage relative to the practice of social development.

<!--
I should also emphasise how much I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy'.
