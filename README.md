# Welcome

This repository is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy has varied articulations and manifestations.  Tracking how social policy is defined and realized over time and across institutions is difficult.  Policy formulations change and evolve, and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive.

This repository seeks to collate information on social policy and to and establish a means of tracking changes in policy articulations in relationship to one another.

I hope that someone other than myself may eventually find this resource, and that my work might help others to analyse articulations and manifestations of international social policy and to better appreciate (and document) their inter-connectedness and their nuance.  

## Caveats and Disclaimers

My work here in an on-going.  Attempting to define a organizational framework for the ever-expanding and ever more complex universe of social policy requires considerable time and effort. I contribute to this repository in the hours when I am not [otherwise engaged](http://aaron-kyle.com). Probably I will never 'finish'. 

I consider no page to be "complete". Most are still very immature in terms of their content. Most pages contain typos. This will be a life-long project for me. If you see spot anything that you'd like to challenge or correct, please send me an email (or better, a submit a pull request).

Also - as noted - my work focuses on social development. As I work on defining terms, I do so with respect to their usage relative to the practice of social development&mdash;I don't worry to much about how a term is used in other disciplines.

<!--
I should also emphasise how much I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy'.
