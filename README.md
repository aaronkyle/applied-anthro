## Context

Social policy has varied articulations and manifestations. This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/) collects contextual information pertinent to social policy, including discussions of [social policy of international financial instutions](./social-policy/), [international-](./international-law_good-practice/) and [country-](./country-safeguard-systems) law and regulatory frameworks, and [helpful resources for social development practitioners](./ifi-implementation-resources/).

In tracking how social policy is [defined](./terms/terminology.html) and [realized](thematic-issues) policy formulations changes and evolves. The relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive. This repository is [open](./license.md) and [public](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development) in the hope that someone (other than myself) may eventually find and use it. Ideally, this repository may one day help others tasked with analyzing social policy and its [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)) manifestations.  
Currently, I am a solo author&mdash;doing my best to keep up with the changes and to identify and analyze inconsistence where I encounter them. [I doubt I will ever finish](/legal/disclaimer). If you find your way here, welcome!  If you'd like to contribute, that'd be amazing. Ideally, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

[`social-policy/`](social-policy) `#` clarifications of the organization of social policy among development financial institutions<br/>
[`thematic-issues/`](thematic-issues) `#`<br/>

[`accountability-mechanisms/`](accountability-mechanisms) `#`<br/>
[`country-safeguard-systems/`](country-safeguard-systems) `#` work on state-level social policy, including compilation of law and analysis of topical issues<br/>
[`ifi-implementation-resources/`](ifi-implementation-resources) `#`<br/>
[`international-law_good-practice/`](international-law_good-practice) `#`<br/>
[`data/`](data) `#` data sets that relate to social development issues<br/>
