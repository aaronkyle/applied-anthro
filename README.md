## Purpose

[Social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/) has varied articulations and manifestations. This repository collates information on how social policy has been articulated by [international financial institutions](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/ifi/) (aka 'development financial institutions') over time and across institutions and analyses how policy articulations manifest in practical application. 

Tracking how social policy is [defined](http://applied-anthro.com/context/) and [realized](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues/) is a difficult and endless endeavor: policy formulations change and evolve and the relationship between seemingly similar [terms](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html) and [concepts](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context) is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive. Currently, I am a solo author&mdash;doing my best to keep up with the changes and to identify and analyze inconsistence where I encounter them. [I doubt I will ever finish](./disclaimer.md).

This repository is [open](./license.md) and [public](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development) in the hope that someone (other than myself) may eventually find and it use. Ideally, this repository may one day help others tasked with analyzing social policy and its [phenomenological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)) manifestations. 

If you find your way here, welcome!  If you see spot anything that you'd like to challenge, change, or correct, please send me an email (or better, a submit a pull request). I'd love to hear from you :)


## Organization

For those reading [via this site's front end](http://applied-anthro.com/), I am slowing building out navigation links and index files to guide your journey through this website.  For now, you'll find that the site is comprised of 'old' and 'new' layouts.  This derives from changes I made in how content is generated an published on line.  Please bear with me; I'll work it out.

For those reading [via GitHub](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development), the repository structure will be apparent.  Here's a few bits of orientation.
