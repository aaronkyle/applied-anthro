## Purpose

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development) is intended as a resource for people interested in, or working with, [social policy](http://applied-anthro.com/terms/social-policy/).

Social policy has varied articulations and manifestations.  Tracking how social policy is defined and realized over time and across institutions is difficult.  Policy formulations change and evolve, and the relationship between seemingly similar terms and concepts is sometimes obtuse and counter-intuitive.

This repository seeks to collate information on social policy and to and establish a means of tracking changes in policy articulations in relationship to one another.

I hope that someone other than myself may eventually find this resource, and that my work might help others to analyse social policy and to better appreciate (and document) the nuanced inter-connectedness of [phenomena](#).  

If you see spot anything that you'd like to challenge, change, or correct, please send me an email (or better, a submit a pull request).
