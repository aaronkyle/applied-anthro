The term **temporality* carries two quite different meanings[1](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/temporality):

   1. the state of existing within or having some relationship with time;
   2. a secular possession, especially the properties and revenues of a religious body or a member of the clergy.

Use of the term in 'social development' usually relates to discussions of time. Often, these discussion relate to human's perception of time and the social organization of time, though the term is occasionally also encountered in discussions of performance monitoring (e.g. the capacity of a given investment to sustain itself over time).

What sorts of time-frames should be used when measuring social development?

Social indicators data—when available—are commonly reported as one-year aggregates.   While such data may be applied to determining general, long-term trends, they can obscure equally significant short-term variable fluctuations.  For instance, while it might be possible that an agricultural technology investment project in a particular township is helping to generate increasingly more grain outputs year-over-year, it may also be the case that this increase in grain production is only helping local farmers to eat more for 3 months per year—for the remainder of the time, farmers starve equally as in years past.  In this case, do our social indicators accurately describe positive and sustained social development, or do they mask the reality that little in changing for how the local community experiences hunger?
