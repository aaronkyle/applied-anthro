Environmental and social audit is defined as an instrument to determine the nature and extent of all
environmental and social areas of concern at an existing project or activities. The audit identifies and
justifies appropriate measures and actions to mitigate the areas of concern, estimates the cost of the
measures and actions, and recommends a schedule for implementing them.
