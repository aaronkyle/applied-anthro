Project-Related Corporate Loans are corporate loans, made to business entities (either privately, publicly, or state-owned or controlled) related to a single Project, either a new development or expansion (e.g. where there is an expanded footprint), where the Known Use of Proceeds is related to a single Project in one of the following ways: 
 
* The lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by the Project as the source of repayment (as in Project Finance) and where security exists in the form of a corporate or parent company guarantee; 
 
* Documentation for the loan indicates that the majority of the proceeds of the total loan are directed to the Project. Such documentation may include the term sheet, information memorandum, credit agreement, or other representations provided by the client into its intended use of proceeds for the loan. 
 
It includes loans to government-owned corporations and other legal entities created by a government to undertake commercial activities on behalf of the government, but excludes loans to national, regional or local governments, governmental ministries and agencies.
