'''Problem-Opportunity-Threat Matching''' is an interactive session where participants examine opportunities that exist in solution of prevailing problems and the threats that may hinder the exploitation of these opportunities. The exercise draws on indigenous knowledge to develop preliminary plans for the solution of problems. Taking stock of possible opportunities and integrating mitigation against threats aids in the design of robust and sustainable interventions.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004">Payne, Geoffrey; Majale, Michael (eds). 2004.
