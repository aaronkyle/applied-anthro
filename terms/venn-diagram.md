## Venn or Chapatti Diagram / Institutional analysis

*Venn diagrams* are usually used for an institutional or stakeholder analysis. This tool allows the relationships between different institutions and groups to be represented visually through drawing overlapping or connected circles. Each circle represents a different institution, group, or actor. The intensity of interaction or overlapping interests can be represented through proximity or degree of overlap between circles. The importance or impact of an institution, actor or interest can be represented through the size of the circle, thickness of the line used or through the thickness and direction of an arrow connecting the circles. What keys and images are used should be decided by the participants and facilitator.

The Venn diagram is often referred to as a chapatti diagram in participatory research circles. This is because Indian chapatti breads, which are round and flat like the circles of the Venn diagram, are often used in the field in India when pens and paper are unavailable or expensive. Other materials which are appropriate to the research context and are easily available can be just as innovatively used. For instance, using a stick to draw diagrams in the earth.
