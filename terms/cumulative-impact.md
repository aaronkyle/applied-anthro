Cumulative impact refers to the incremental impact of the project when added to impacts from other
relevant past, present and reasonably foreseeable developments as well as unplanned but predictable
activities enabled by the project that may occur later or at a different location. Cumulative impacts can
result from individually minor but collectively significant activities taking place over a period of time.
