[[Category:Methods]]
'''Participatory Appraisal''' is a community-based consultation method that prioritizes the views of local people and their active involvement in deciding what happens in their communities, or how what happens affects them. It is increasingly used in policy formulation and practical development due to its reputation as a quick, cheap, simple and socially inclusive method of uncovering pertinent issues and needs within communities.

Groups of people from a community are gathered together and discuss issues they feel are pertinent in the community. This is combined with the drawing up of visual maps, mind maps, charts and diagrams by the participants, which visually represent such issues as community needs, services, interactions between institutions, livelihood strategies and resources. This produces a range of data that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, or be used directly.

The discussion is semi-structured and uses open questions. This allows the participants to define their own priorities and express their diverse perceptions. Issues and problems which emerge in the discussion are jointly analyzed by the group through a range of tools (these are described below).

Visual tools and methods are used flexibly and innovatively according to the context, the shape which the discussion takes on and what participants choose to focus on. The visual dimension of the tools is good for representing many complex issues that would be difficult to verbalize or write-down coherently. Working visually is a natural way of working through problems and ideas, and is useful for overcoming language and literacy barriers.

This is a cheap, quick and effective method. As a technique, it does not require expensive technologies or programs, and even pens and paper can be replaced with a dirt road and stone or chalk, whatever materials are available. However, it must be remembered that, as with all participatory methods, much of the costs in time and effort are transferred to the participants themselves. If participants’ contributions are not acknowledged during policy formulation, the exercise will have wasted vulnerable people’s valuable resources and they are unlikely to contribute to future projects.


==Variations of Participatory Appraisal==

*[[Rapid Rural Appraisal]]
*[[Participatory Rural Appraisal]] 
*[[Participatory Urban Appraisal]]


==Strengths==

*Participants keep control of process.
*Capacity-building through group problem analysis.
*Encourages change and encourages people to act.
*Flexibility of the topics that can be covered in one session and how they are approached.
*Methods are adaptable and can be sequenced differently according to local conditions.
*Can be used in any location.
*Can be used with all age groups and people of all backgrounds.
*Visual forms of representation mean it can be used in areas with high illiteracy.
*Gives tangible and precise data.
*Useful for gaining different forms of information.
*The data generated can be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.

==Weaknesses==

*Some tools require group agreement, which can cause problems.
*It is not possible to represent all forms of information visually.
*In a group situation it is difficult to address deeper issues in sufficient detail.
*May lack the depth which can be gained through in-depth interviews
*Group dynamics and power structures can mean the opinions of some participants are suppressed unless a skilled facilitator is present.
*Information and data collected may not be easily comparable to data generated in other groups or contexts.
*The facilitator must be very skilled and flexible, as there are no blueprints of how to design and combine the tools.


==Notes for Facilitators==

The role of the facilitator is very important in participatory appraisal tools. The researcher should only facilitate, not direct or control the research process. With this approach it is the members of the community themselves who carry out and define the research, while the facilitator simply ensures everyone is able to participate and explains the tools available.

It is the responsibility of the facilitator not only to precipitate and encourage discussion, but also to ensure that the discussion is as inclusive as possible and not dominated totally by the more vocal members of the group, and therefore that everyone participates in deciding what goes on paper. It is not uncommon for more submissive participants to agree with a dominant opinion to avoid confrontation, or for participants to simply copy each others ideas. With certain tools consensus is less problematic, as it is possible to get all participants to put down their ideas, and if necessary justify them if the others do not agree (such as casual impact diagrams). However where there is a single outcome (such as timelines, institutional maps ) it is important that the less confident participants are encouraged to talk, and that the others listen.

Discussion should be kept as free-flowing as possible, though it is important to keep the discussion directed. It will therefore be useful to draw up a card with key issues to address during the discussion, though this should only be used flexibly as a form of guidance which is likely to change as new themes emerge. These key issues can be drawn up within the group at the start of discussion.

It is advisable to start with a relatively straightforward tool, such as problem listing and ranking, as the discussions leading from this may cover a range of different issues, which can then be followed up using other tools to express and analyze them. As such, it is important not to plan a set number and type of tools, as this limits and formalizes the process and removes the effect of natural discussion. So while the facilitator retains control of suggesting and initiating certain tools which are appropriate to the discussion, it is the participants who determine the contents and direction of the discussion itself, and hence the outcome which is facilitated by the tools. It is possible to dedicate a session to a particular topic in order that the issue can be covered in greater depth, such as access to housing. 

More information on participatory methods can be found in Chambers 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, Davis & Whittington 1998, Mosse 1994, Moser & McIlwaine 1999, and Nelson & Wright 1995.


==Group structure==

If you are trying to elicit the points of view of particular stakeholders or groups, the participants in the discussion groups may be selected to represent these groups. However, it is usually beneficial to also have mixed groups to gain a better understanding of the diversity of views. This will also enhance the learning process as participants work through differences of opinion and analyze issues jointly.

It often helps to have both mixed-gender groups and single-gender groups for different participatory appraisal tools. This principle can also be applied to any other power hierarchies or group identities within the community, e.g. age, ethnicity etc. Different dynamics are likely to emerge according to the structure of the group. By using a variety of group compositions and tools the facilitator can ensure that people feel comfortable expressing different views, and that all the participants’ views are elicited. The structure of groups will, however, be dependent on who is available for and willing to participate in the discussion groups.

If participatory appraisal is being used as a key method in research, it is often good to try to meet the same group more than once. This will allow for a continuity of themes, and will create a better rapport and sense of being part of the process for the participants.


==Location==

The group discussions can take place in most locations where you find people: social and community organizations, churches, schools, in the house of a participant, and in the street. Choose the location that is most accessible to the participants and avoid contexts which may intimidate them.


==Timing==

Ideally, each group discussion session should last between 45 minutes and 1½ hours which allows enough time to collect significant data but prevents momentum being lost.


==Types of Tools==

===Listing and ranking===

Identifies what problems, priorities, or issues are considered most and least important by respondents, e.g. defining what regulations participants feel are most important, or what regulations present bigger barriers.


===Cause, effect & solution flow charts===

Identification and analysis of problems, their impacts, relationships and possible solutions, e.g. the constraints represented by regulatory frameworks, or the impacts on livelihoods of resorting to illegal housing mechanisms.


===Mind Mapping===

An issue is discussed and explored and the interrelating issues of varying relevance are identified.


===Coping strategies and solutions===

Problems are identified by the group, and their strategies for coping with or overcoming these problems are outlined. Solutions can be identified e.g. through the strategies adopted by participants trying to negotiate regulatory frameworks.


===[[Well-being ranking and analysis]]===

Identifies local criteria and perceptions of well-being (e.g. land, animals, credit, family structure, number of children) and ranks households according to these criteria using tables, cards or a map.


===Community map===

A map of the community is drawn up by the group. This helps to identify locations and supply of services and infrastructure etc. Helps to familiarize the researcher with the local community.


===[[Venn/Chapatti diagram and Institutional matrix]]===

The relationships between, and interests of, different institutions and groups are represented visually through overlapping or connected circles.


===Timelines and Trend analysis===

Shows trends in availability of work, population growth, land division, resources etc., or ordering of events and points of change.


===[[Income and Expenditure]]===

The types and amount of income are listed for an individual or household. Expenditures, assets needed and time spent are listed for different time scales or for specific issues such as accessing housing.


===Mobility/Migration matrix===

Identifies where people go and why. This can also include issues such as commuting and use of services etc.


===[[Activity Calendar]]===

Identifies the range of livelihood activities undertaken in a community or household, and the divisions of labour, or amount of resources distribute to each activity etc.

<br/>While participatory appraisal was originally intended as a complete research approach, it is also possible to use only a small number of participatory appraisal tools within a wider multi-method research approach, for instance within a focus group discussion or stakeholder analysis. In fact it is often advisable to use participatory appraisal in conjunction with other methods to gain a greater depth for your research.

As can be seen in the above table, several Participatory Appraisal tools can be of assistance in gathering information on regulatory frameworks and their relationships to different groups, particularly low-income groups. Some of the tools which can be most usefully used in a regulatory audit are discussed in more depth here.
