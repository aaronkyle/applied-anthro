Through stakeholder engagement and empirical research, analysis identify the range of people and social groups who might be affected by a project or policy—either negatively or positively. It is helpful when investigating and analysing the interests, roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders relative to a particular policy or investment decision. Stakeholder analysis is often undertaken early on during project planning to clarify key questions and to acertain public and community interests.</p>
<!--
A stakeholder analysis can be done using a variety of methods including reviews of documentation, interviews, participatory research tools and focus groups.

An example procss follows:

1. Undertake a desk-top review of all relevant documentation.
1. List all the parties who you believe have a stake in the issues to be addressed at different levels and by type (from households through to national or even international institutions). List their believed roles and responsibilities. When doing a regulatory audit this should include the designers and implementers of policies, the groups impacted by policies and champions of change in those policies.
1. Have open-ended interviews with individuals who you believe represent the parties you have listed. Ask them to confirm your understanding of their stake in the issues and to suggest others who should be consulted.
Invite representatives of all the stakeholders you have listed to a workshop, participatory appraisal discussion group or focus group discussion.
1. Using a mind-map tool ask participants to map out on flip charts how they see their position in the sector in relation to others, using arrows to indicate where one group controls or influences another. A Venn diagram can also be used for this. Ask them to indicate how information or knowledge about access (to land, credit, leverage, returns) flows and where there are bottlenecks. You could now ask participants to draw a new “bottom line” chart showing only those stakeholders who absolutely need to be involved and what the ideal relationships between them should be. (Record the discussion between them as this is often more interesting than the final outcome drawn on the flip charts).
1. Using these various sources of information a stakeholder table or matrix can be completed.
Later in the research cycle when policy recommendations have been generated, a stakeholder analysis could be undertaken again to analyse the potential impacts of these recommendations on stakeholders and possible barriers to change.



Examples of questions to be asked when undertaking an institutional or stakeholder analysis of a community:

* How many local groups or institutions are there? Who participates in them? e.g. elders, women, traders. What are their purposes?
* Who occupies leadership positions? Are leadership positions dominated by a particular social group, (e.g. high caste, wealthy, elderly, men)? *Which institutions have had achievements related to meeting community development needs?
* What external institutions have an impact on the community? What are their purposes?
* Which local institutions have links with these outside institutions? For what purposes? What flows of information, resources and power are there between the institutions?

<p>Stakeholder analysis is also helpful in understanding and predicting site-level risks and opportunities for communities when crafting an optimal portfolio of community investment.<a href="http://commdev.org/userfiles/SRMining%20Veronica%20Nyhan%20Jones,%20Jelena%20Lukic,%20Arjun%20Bhalla,%20Dafna%20Tapiero%20-%20July%2015.pdf">FN^1</a> It draws on the company’s existing analysis of project-induced risks and benefits-sharing opportunities. Stakeholder analysis allows project managers to nuance their engagement with specific stakeholder groups. For example, when investigation options for urban housing, stakeholder analysis may involve differenating between categories of land tenure and home ownership, such as owners, renters and the homeless. Other potential stakeholders for an urban development initiative are regulators and officials, housing developers and suppliers, professionals such as architects and lawyers, local and national politicians, finance and credit institutions and representatives of NGOs and CBOs.</p>
<p>Project managers can perform on-going analysis of stakeholder groups to identify any that may not be unintentionally excluded from benefits-sharing initiatives or to identify potential conflicts of interest for a proposed investment scheme. When managers are seeking to implement change or to initiate an activity, stakeholder analysis can help to identify ‘champions of change’, groups who might resist change, and even useful commonalities of interest to build on when negotiating and selecting social development inititatives. </p>
