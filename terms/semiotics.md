**Semiotics** is the study of how meaning is made through the interpretation of signs, symbols, and signification, such as in the processes of indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication.

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological dimensions; for example, the late Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.

Some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the life sciences—such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). In general, semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in biosemiotics (including zoosemiotics).


Charles Morris adds that semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; and, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, that is, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs.

Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems.

Definition
Apart from the prefix “ic,” used to turn adjectives into nouns, the Oxford English Dictionary online gives no etymology for the word “semiotics” leading one to believe that the word itself has not changed over time. What has changed, as illustrated by the two definitions of the OED, is the meaning of the word. From the original definition of “the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms” to its more familiar use as, “the science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language,” (Semiotics, 2010) is the evolution of a concept.

It is therefore possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life. It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology. We shall call it semiology (from the Greek semeion, ‘sign’). It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist. But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance. (Saussure, 1986; pp. 15-16, emphasis original)

The above quote recognizably from Saussure’s Course in General Linguistics which debuted in 1916 defends Saussure’s title as “the father of semiotics.” Given the fact that Saussure himself did a great deal to establish the field of semiotics, with his explication on the nature of signs and sign systems in the appendix to General Linguistics, his expressed doubt earlier in the text seems more than a little ironic.

Another quote from a founding semiotician will shed light on why an encyclopedic entry of this sort is so difficult to write, “Semiotic has for its goal a general theory of signs in all their forms and manifestations, whether in animals or men, whether normal or pathological, whether linguistic or nonlinguistic, whether personal or social. Semiotic is thus an interdisciplinary enterprise” (Morris, 1964; p.1). Morris’ definition is broader in scope than the definition provided by the OED. However, for the purpose of this entry semiotics will be explored in a way that lines up more closely with the OED’s definition than that of the semiotician. That is, this entry will attempt to illustrate the difference between Saussure and Peirce’s conception of sign systems and then comment on Barthes and Silverstein to to provide the reader with an idea of the evolution of the concept of semiotics as it applies to the discipline of communication from its inception to the present.[[#_ftn1|[1]]]

Within the field of semiotics there are two foundational questions. First, what is a sign? Second, how are signs used? This second question opens the way to the idea of sign systems, communities of sign-users, and has been responsible for much of the proliferation of scholarship collected under the heading of semiotics. However, the first question must be answered before scholars are able to move to the second. Many theorists have attempted to answer this first question but there are two preeminent scholars whose work stands above the rest and to which other scholars keep turning time and time again.

One of these scholars is, of course, Ferdinand Saussure. In the appendix to General Linguistics Saussure lays out his basic ideas of the nature of signs and sign systems. According to Saussure there are two general principles governing the use of signs: the sign is arbitrary and signs have a linear character, meaning they occupy a space and time and that occupation can only be measured in one direction. From these two general principles Saussure develops the ideas of the variability and invariability of signs. Signs are invariable because of their arbitrary nature and the complexity of sign systems. The fact that any language will be made up of almost innumerable signs and that these signs interact in complex ways, relying on their relations with other signs to construct meaning, are Saussure’s second and third reasons for arguing that signs are invariable. The fourth reason, to which Saussure ascribes the most importance, is that collective inertia protects individual signs from change. Saussure allows that there can be changes between the sign and the signified and these changes, which can be documented but not observed, are the evolution of language. Thus, Saussure conceives of an interaction between a sign system and a sign-using community taking place over time (Saussure, 1964; pp. 70-78). For a complete list of Saussure's work and related readings, see page 267 through 271 of The Cambridge Companion to Saussure (2004).


Classification of Signs (Peirce)
Charles Peirce focused on the nature of signs to create an elegant way of classifying signs. Peirce has three divisions of signs each of which has three sub-categories. The first division of signs refers to properties of the signs themselves and includes the following:
qualisign (a quality which is a sign),
sinsign (an actual thing which is a sign); and
legisign (a law, usually established by human consensus, which is a sign).

The second division of signs refers to how a sign relates to its object and includes the following:
icon (a sign which is like the object or is used as a sign for the object),
index (a sign for an object because it is actually affected by that object), and
symbol (a sign for an object because a law connects them).

The third division refers to how signs relate to their interpretant and includes the following:
rheme (a sign which represents a possible object),
a dicent sign (a sign for an actually existent object), and
an argument (a sign of law) (Peirce, 1955; pp. 101-109).

According to Peirce, there are ten possible classifications of these signs. The restriction to ten follows from the fact that combinations of categories are based of the relationship of sign, object, and interpretant (Tejera, 1988; p. 18). Whereas Saussure never lets the reader forget the relation between a sign and a sign-user, one gets the sense that Peirce’s classification, except for the signs that depend on law (sign user consensus), would be much the same without a sign user.

In the seminal 1977 piece “Rhetoric of the Image,” Roland Barthes, inspired by Saussure, analyzes the uses of signs within an advertisement for an Italian food products. Barthes identifies three types of messages within the print advertisement under consideration: a linguistic message, denoted message, and connoted message. The linguistic message can serve either the purpose of anchoring (guiding perception) or relay (conveying messages not to be found in the image itself) (Barthes, 1985; 196-198).

According to Barthes, “the denoted images naturalizes the symbolic message” (Barthes, p. 201) meaning that, though there is an image presented, there is no code inherent in the image and so the image itself seems natural and without code. The connoted message exists in an almost symbiotic relationship with the denoted image. The connoted image is full of meaning from the sources of metonymy and ideology. This meaning is both expressed in the image and brought to the image by the viewer. While the connoted image conveys a message the denoted image makes that message seem natural (Barthes, 202-204). While Barthes analysis itself is fascinating it is the application of Saussurean semiotics to an the image that is really worthwhile. For instance, his definition of the connoted image echoes the fundamental interplay between sign and sign user in Saussure’s semiotics.

Though Michael Silverstein never references Peirce in his analysis of language and culture in which he argues that certain speech acts are the only form of culture that evokes symbolism (1976, p. 220) a reader would be hard pressed to make sense of Silverstein’s definitions referential and non-referential index without first encountering Peirce. Although this piece is not strictly Peircean, Silverstein’s classification of speech acts according to index, function, and meta-pragmatics has a love of order not uncharacteristic of Peirce. However, Silverstein brilliantly applies the ideas of index and reference to speech acts to delineate the difference between culture in language and in speech. By applying semiotic principles to the study of culture in away that is not classifiable strictly in the usual terms of structuralism or post-structuralism or linguistic Silverstein creates an interesting new place for semiotics within communicative, linguistic, and cultural studies[[#_msocom_2|[NO2]]] .

The discussion of semiotics branches into the discussion of polysemy, which occurs when multiple sign users interpret signs to have multiple "meanings" or "senses" that create ambiguity of understanding (Paulin, 7). Though polysemy has a rich history in semantic studies, it also plays a role in cultural studies that examine texts such as film and television shows for the signs put on display. Polysemy as a research approach acknowledges the subjectivity of the researcher and does not make attempts to establish the formal or official meaning of signs for all sign users.

semiotics

What is semiotics in light of today’s theories of media? Instead of asking ‘what semiotics means in today’s media study,’ this opening question reveal the complexity and ambiguity of how semiotics and the generation of meaning are deployed in contemporary theories of media. Semiotics, the term itself directs to complex theories of signs and/or an array of disciplines mostly pertaining to logic, linguistics, and representational art, is used as a theoretical and/or analytical tool for contemporary media studies. Today, the problem of using semiotics as theoretical/analytical tool for media studies is that the term itself has aroused debates on its linguistic and non-linguistic natures in relation to its usage in media studies. This theoretical skepticism of semiotics echoes the debate on “Word and Image” within media studies, which denotes the over-generalization on medium specificity and purity. On one hand, there are optimistic art historians such as Mieke Bal and Norman Bryson who think semiotics’s transdisciplinary nature is the answer to avoiding the privileging of language when conducting cross-disciplinary studies. [1] On the other hand, scholars challenge semiotics’ potential in achieving “neutrality in the metalanguages of representation.” [2] Since this entry is meant to be an introductory reference for the term ‘semiotics,’ I will try to point out the key traits in the terms’ historical usage, its innate oscillation between linguistic and non-linguistic, and some theoretical usage it has laid for studies of representations with understandable abbreviation.

By tracing the early appearance of the term ‘semiotics,’ the labor already points to the term’s interdisciplinary nature. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), semiotics concerns with 1) “the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of symptoms” and 2) “the science of communication studied through the interpretation of signs and symbols as they operate in various fields, esp. language.” [3] OED’s first traceable appearance of the term is in early Enlightenment physician and philosopher Henry Stubbe’s The Plus ultra reduced to a nonplus, or a specimen of some animadversions upon the Plus ultra of Mr. Glanvill (1670), which indicates that semiotics is “method of curing, and tried…medicines.” [4] However, at this stage, the terms ‘semiotics’ and ‘semiotic’ [3] (i.e. without the ‘s’) are interchangeable, and while both terms have their implication about the medical study of symptoms, ‘semiotic’ points to the study of signs when it appears in John Locke’s An essay concerning humane understanding (1690) to indicate “the Doctrine of Signs.” [5] While this early account of semiotic(s) already shows the dual genealogies—that of medical symptom and doctrine of signs—the contemporary usage nevertheless continues the term’s dual pedigrees.

The contemporary usage of the term is the pedigree of semiotics and semiology, or the American and European traditions about theories of sign and how meaning is generated in relation to signs. Two founders of major contemporary sign theories are the American logician/philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (C.S. Peirce, 1839-1914) and the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913). Each places different focuses on how meaning is produced by signs, and both, with their successors, have their oscillations between the semiotic/semiology’s linguistic and nonlinguistic implications. [5]

C.S. Peirce [6] uses the term semiotic as a synonym for logic, which is the name for the “formal, doctrine of signs”. [7] For Peirce, semiotics is composed of triadic structures, which in terms conveys the interdependent relationships between elements of triads. Peirce’s semiotics is foremost composed by sign-interpretant-object triadic relations.


[8]

A sign, said Peirce, is “something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity.” [9] The sign creates another sign in the mind of that ‘somebody,’ and this another sign is the interpretant of the first sign. Interpretant is not a person; rather, it is somehow similar to Saussure’s signified, i.e. interpretant is the mental concept elicited in somebody’s mind. The object is the something that the sign stands for, or the external reality of the sign. SCHOOL (sign) may refer to the physical buildings in which student learns (object), but SCHOOL may not be the sign if it does not cause a mental concept (interpretant) when the person perceives SCHOOL. One very important note on Peirce’s semiotic is that even though I use SCHOOL as an example for a sign, Peirce’s triadic sign structure does not limit to linguistic tradition. In fact, Peirce’s semiotic, and later in Nelson Goodman’s Languages of Art [10], may be seen as an early account on what W. J. T. Mitchell proposes as the “pictorial turn” on the history of philosophy because their semiotics draws largely on nonlinguistic sign system and, contrary to Saussure, do not assume that “language is paradigmatic for meaning.” [11] Instead, Peirce emphasizes the dynamic relations between sign, interpretant, and object, which lead to the process of signification, or semiosis. As Bal and Bryson indicates, “[semiosis] involves the production and the interpretation of signs, both equally fundamental …[and] provides a logical basis for a reader- or reception-oriented theory of art.” [12] Consequently, in light of semiosis, the generating of meanings is not the transmission of messages (which concerns with how messages transmit from sender to receiver), i.e. not as the linear model of how message is transmitted, but the structural model of how meaning is created. How meaning is generated therefore puts emphases on three aspects: the sign itself, the code or the systems into which signs are organized, and the context/culture into which these codes and signs operate. [13]

Contemporary to Peirce but coming from the linguistic side, Ferdinand de Saussure uses the term semiology to describe the study of signs. In Course in General Linguistics Saussure writes, semiology is “a science which would study the life of signs within society… We call it semiology, from the Greek semeion (‘sign’).” [14] Similar to Peirce, Saussure’s model on sign is structural. However, unlike Peirce’s triadic structure, Saussure’s system of sign is dyadic. For Saussure, a sign is made up with two parts: the signified and the signifier. The signifier is the physical existence of the sign, and the signified is the mental concept of the sign as we perceive it. The classic example of the word ARBOR being the signifier and the signified is the mental concept appeared in the reader’s mind when the reader sees the ARBOR. Combining the physical word ARBOR and the mental-concept-in-reader’s-mind, we have a sign. Here, it is important to repeat that a sign always has two parts: the signifier and the signified. We could not say that ARBOR itself is a sign if the word does not elicit any mental concept in the beholder’s mind. Therefore, the relationship between the signified and the signifier is very important, yet arbitrary. To say that the relationship between the signified and the signifier is arbitrary is to say that the relationship is largely determined by the culture and/or context in which signs are used. Thus, for Saussure, in order to understand how language functions, we must “set to one side both the aspects of historical change within particular languages over time and actual utterances or performances of language in local situations.” [15]

While Saussure’s paradigm of sign is primarily linguistic, one of his successors, Roland Barthes takes a shift to include image in his system of signs when he employed the triadic structure of “Image-Music-Text,” which structurally echoes Aristotle’s melos-opsis-lexis and Peirce’s icon-index-symbol. At this, the seemingly distinctive linguistic/nonlinguistic paradigms in Saussure and Peirce seem to converge for a moment when the systems of sign are no longer separated by the paradigms of “word and image,” but at the same time a new divergence has appeared according to how signs are classified. While Barthes does not have an urgent agenda to press for medium specificity as Clement Greenberg has done, he tries to distinctly separate music, image, and text as belongs to separate sign systems. [16] However, as W.J.T. Mitchell argues in “Word and Image,” it is impossible to separate image and text when discussing the constructed relationship between representation and reality but rather to look at divides of mediums as symptoms of larger social constructs. [17]

Recall that Peirce’s semiosis, or the process in which signs generate meaning, is a reader-oriented theory which depends largely on the context/culture. Peirce’s trichotomies of sign— icon-index-symbol— which is classified according to the degree of relation between the sign to object, [18] does provide more freedom than Barthes’ separation of medium according to form.



[19]

For instance, Rosalind Krauss’ influential essays on index and seventies’ American art not only provide an attempt to discuss Peirce’s emphasis that the real and existential relation between index and object is indispensable yet does not confine to reality, that the index and its meaning comes within the image itself. [20]

In conclusion, contemporary theories of media utilizes semiotics as a tool, but it is still unsettled whether semiotics is a “neutral transdisciplinary theory” as Bal and Bryson have proposed, or as Mitchell have responded that semiotics is “a host of new figures or theoretical pictures that must themselves be interpreted.” [21] Perhaps this unsettlement will lead us to consider semiotics itself as a medium, in which the material practices generated by sign may produce a larger picture of the society. Until then, as W. J. T. Mitchell proposes, we might try to taxonomize different mediums according to their distinct sensory and semiotic ratios. [22]

Semiotics, or semiology, is the study of signs, symbols, and signification. It is the study of how meaning is created, not what it is. Below are some brief definitions of semiotic terms, beginning with the smallest unit of meaning and proceeding towards the larger and more complex:

Signifier: any material thing that signifies, e.g., words on a page, a facial expression, an image.

Signified: the concept that a signifier refers to.

Together, the signifier and signified make up the

Sign: the smallest unit of meaning. Anything that can be used to communicate (or to tell a lie).

Symbolic (arbitrary) signs: signs where the relation between signifier and signified is purely conventional and culturally specific, e.g., most words.

Iconic signs: signs where the signifier resembles the signified, e.g., a picture.

Indexical Signs: signs where the signifier is caused by the signified, e.g., smoke signifies fire.

Denotation: the most basic or literal meaning of a sign, e.g., the word "rose" signifies a particular kind of flower.

Connotation: the secondary, cultural meanings of signs; or "signifying signs," signs that are used as signifiers for a secondary meaning, e.g., the word "rose" signifies passion.

Metonymy: a kind of connotation where in one sign is substituted for another with which it is closely associated, as in the use of Washington for the United States government or of the sword for military power.

Synecdoche: a kind of connotation in which a part is used for the whole (as hand for sailor).

Collections of related connotations can be bound together either by

Paradigmatic relations: where signs get meaning from their association with other signs,

or by

Syntagmatic relations: where signs get meaning from their sequential order, e.g., grammar or the sequence of events that make up a story.

Myths: a combination of paradigms and syntagms that make up an oft-told story with elaborate cultural associations, e.g., the cowboy myth, the romance myth.

Codes: a combination of semiotic systems, a supersystem, that function as general maps of meaning, belief systems about oneself and others, which imply views and attitudes about how the world is and/or ought to be. Codes are where semiotics and social structure and values connect.

Ideologies: codes that reinforce or are congruent with structures of power. Ideology works largely by creating forms of "common sense," of the taken-for-granted in everyday life.
