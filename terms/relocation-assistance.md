The term *relocation assistance* refers to support provided to people who are physically displaced by a project. Assistance may include transportation, food shelter, and social services that are provided to affected people during their relocation. Assistance may also include cash allowances that compensate affected people for the inconvenience associated with resettlement and defray the expenses of a transition to a new locale, such as moving expenses and lost work days.
