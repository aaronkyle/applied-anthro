The term ‘social analysis’ refers to the practice of analyzing a situation or social issue, problem or trend through objective, systematic exploration&mdash;often with the aim of prompting changes in the situation being analyzed. [For the World Bank in particular](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/communitydrivendevelopment/brief/cdd-economic-social-analysis), "social analysis is a process that aims to identify the social dimensions of projects, as well as analyze the different stakeholder perspectives and priorities".

Social issuse include such topics as cost of and access to healthcare, quality and content of educational programmes, the capacity and coverage of infrastructure and basic services, etc.  Social problems are situation that are viewed by community members as being undesirable, such as increases in criminality, exposure to risks of environmental pollution, the decline of locally-viable markets, job loss and job outsourcing, etc.

Social analysis aims to offer a critical and theoretical understanding of cultural, political, and social processes. Social analytiucal lines of inquiry are traditioonally organized around themes such as urbanization, commodification, movement of peoples, transnational exchange, identity formations, ethnic and disaporic cultures, production of human suffering, poverty, prejudice, etc. Study design and methodologies often draw upon a variety of different lines of analytical inquiry&mdash;both qualitative and quantitative. The practice of social analysis tends to be critical, empirical, and cross-disciplinary&mdash;incorporating critical methodologies and theoretical insights from such fields as social geography, feminism and queer studies, ethnic studies, critical race theory, labor studies, and cultural studies. Social analysis is often carried out by cooperative, multi-party research teams. 

Some of the lead theorists and practitions of social analysis challenge hegemonic paradigms through "grounded theory" and empirical research.

Social analysis at the World Bank involves examining the socio-cultural, institutional, historical and political context of the operations they finance. The World Bank [utilize social analysis](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/communitydrivendevelopment/brief/cdd-economic-social-analysis) to understand the opportunities, constraints and the likely social impacts associated with a project. World Bank efforts in social analysis seek to incorporate stakeholders' views, establish participatory processes, and inform the design of strategies for inclusion, cohesion and accountability.

Understanding the social implications of projects and policies is critical in ensuring that the proposed project or policy contributes to equitable and sustainable development. Social analysis  can provide insight into social diversity and gender, institutions, rules and behavior, stakeholder dynamics, participation concerns and social risks.

Insight gained from combining social analysis techniques and CRM analytics can also help organizations create business strategies and policies that are sensitive to particular social issues and likely to be perceived by customers as having a positive social impact.

For example, after discovering through analysis of a customer survey that increased efforts to develop renewable energy would be viewed in a positive light, an oil company might decide to expand its investments in biogas, geothermal energy and solar power research.

Since 1984, the World Bank has been institutionalizing some type of social analysis in its investment operations. Currently, about 50 percent of Bank operations undergo some form of social analysis. Two decades of social analysis across the regions have resulted in a solid body of knowledge for learning from our successes and failures, as well as for standardizing many of the methods, tools and skills involved.

At the investment project level, the Social Analysis and Policy Thematic Group works to assure quality and consistency by developing standards and disseminating good practice on:

* Project Social Analysis , undertaken by the Bank for sociological appraisal of the opportunities, constraints and likely impacts as an integral part of investment project appraisal, to examine whether the project's likely social development outcomes have been clearly identified, the project is socially sustainable, and Bank support is justified.
* Social Assessment , undertaken by the Borrower to identify the social dimensions of investment projects, provide spaces to incorporate stakeholders' views into project design, and to establish a participatory process for implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

The recently published Social Analysis Sourcebook presents a conceptual framework for project level social analysis which systematizes and streamlines the lessons learned and good practices developed, and describes how the Bank and its clients can incorporate the social dimensions of development into project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Currently, the team is also working in collaboration with regional colleagues and sectoral networks within the Bank on developing Sector-specific Guidelines for Social Analysis , which will eventually be published as Annexes to the Sourcebook . As and when these become available, they will be made available on this website.

With the increasing emphasis on Sector-Wide Approaches and instruments (eg SWAps) - further blurring the distinctions between project and macro-level social analysis - the team is also actively involved with developing appropriate social analytical responses and guidance to help task teams and clients integrate social dimensions at the sector-level.

For further information on lessons learned and good practices, see the Social Development Notes and Social Development Papers listed in the Publications section.

Social analysis enables the World Bank to assess whether a proposed program or operation is likely to meet its social objectives and to recommend measures that will ensure that these objectives are met.

Social analysis involves examining the socio-cultural, institutional, historical and political context of Bank financed operations, as well as analyzing stakeholder views and priorities, and including as many relevant stakeholders as feasible in the development process. 

In collaboration with regional departments and networks of the World Bank, the Social Development Department (SDV) through the Social Analysis and Policy Thematic Group, works to mainstream social analysis within Bank operations, both at the project and macro level, by developing standards and disseminating good practices for social analysis and policy issues:

Social Analysis at the Project Level : the group assists task teams and clients with ensuring quality and consistency of investment operations through Project Social Analysis , and Social Assessment . The recently published Social Analysis Sourcebook presents a conceptual framework which helps systematize and streamline Bank and Clients social analysis work.

Social Analysis at the Macro Level : increasingly social analysis is also applied at the macro-level, through upstream Country/Macro Social Analysis , and Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) . A database compiling country-level indicators on social development, SDStats , was recently launched on the Bank's internal website and will shortly be made publicly available on this website. SDV has also developed A User's Guide to Poverty and Social Impact Analysis in collaboration with the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management network (PREM).
Social Development and Quality Assurance : the group also coordinates SDV's work on Quality Assurance. SDV, in coordination with PREM, assists the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) by providing specialized reviews of the social and poverty aspects, including gender, of World Bank operations. Additional Quality Assurance work done includes reviews of key corporate documents, as well as of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits.

Social analysis at the World Bank involves examining the socio-cultural, institutional, historical and political context within which the World Bank works. Through social analysis the World Bank assesses whether its programs and operations are likely to meet their social objectives and identifies measures that will ensure that these objectives are achieved. Social analysis also helps to assess the likely outcomes, impacts and social risks that need to be considered in the design of projects and programs, including the views and priorities of relevant stakeholders.  

Complementing economic analysis, social analysis assesses the likelihood that the World Bank’s operations will be socially sustainable and that its social benefits and economic opportunities will be widely shared. It identifies opportunities and constraints arising from the country's socio-cultural, institutional, historical and political context to prepare strategies and programs that contribute to the country's development objectives as well as to the Bank's core mission of poverty reduction. In particular, social analysis helps to incorporate the goals of equity and social inclusion into the World Bank’s projects and programs.

At the World Bank, social analysis is undertaken on multiple levels.  The World Bank conducts social analysis on the country-level, as inputs into the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) process or other key policy documents, on the sector-level to support policy reforms and sector strategies, and on the project-level, as an integral part of project appraisal to judge whether the project's social development outcomes have been clearly identified and Bank support is justified. Additionally, a social assessment may be undertaken by the Borrower for the purpose of obtaining the views of stakeholders in order to improve the design of the project and establishing a participatory process for implementation and monitoring.
