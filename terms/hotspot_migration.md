From IFC (2009: 62), “hotspots” refers to “the likely destination/s of in-migrants that need to be protected from, and prepared for, an expected wave of project-induced in-migration”. In other words, consideration of hotspots needs both to predict where migrants are most likely to congregate , as well as what effect their presence will have for each locality.

The “Potential Hotspots” Excel provides a template

rubric for comparative analysis of unique and discernible geographic units

 (i.e. the charted rubric could be used to examine differences between project-affected villages, between sub-districts, districts, and provinces, as well as to make international comparisons).

The implication of the accompanying “Hotspot Map,” is that it depicts the probability of in-migration to each existing village in the project CoW area (Sheet 2), based on some amalgam / value-ranking of the total set of indices that constitute the rubric (Sheet 1).
