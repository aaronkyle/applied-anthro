'''Problem Ranking''' allows the affected residents to highlight and compare problems in the community or problems related to a particular theme such as accessing housing. These problems are then organized into a hierarchical ranking by either using a matrix diagram or by organizing the problems on cards using a card sorting exercise. This can be used to uncover the problems people feel create barriers to accessing affordable legal housing. The regulations and standards which residents feel represent the greatest constraints to them can also be identified.
