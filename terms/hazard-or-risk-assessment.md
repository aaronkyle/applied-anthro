Hazard or risk assessment is defined as an instrument for identifying, analyzing, and controlling hazards
associated with the presence of dangerous materials and conditions at a project site. The Bank requires a
hazard or risk assessment for projects involving certain inflammable, explosive, reactive, and toxic
materials when they are present in quantities above a specified threshold level.
