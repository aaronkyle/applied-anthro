The term **visioning** refers to a consultation tool for learning about community preferences during early phases of project design.  When conducting a visioning exercise, community members are asked to describe ideal or aspirational notions of a given development initiative at a given point in time.  

For example, when planning a resettlement site with a rural village community, the villagers might be asked to describe how the site would be organized. Would each home have a toilet inside, or should sanitary facilities be communal and located outside the main settlement area?  Should the community marketplace for a coastal community be built near to the dock, or should it be located in the middle of town?  Should the village be organized according to a particular social hierarchy?  What types of build materials should be used, and which should be avoided?

Visioning can help to focus community consultation by seeking to establish quantifiable targets to be accomplished in a defined period.
