Forced eviction is defined as the permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals,
families, and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy without the provision of,
and access to, appropriate forms of legal and other protection, including all applicable procedures and
principles in ESS5. The exercise of eminent domain, compulsory acquisition or similar powers by a
Borrower will not be considered to be forced eviction providing it complies with the requirements of
national law and the provisions of ESS5, and is conducted in a manner consistent with basic principles of
due process (including provision of adequate advance notice, meaningful opportunities to lodge
grievances and appeals, and avoidance of the use of unnecessary, disproportionate or excessive force)
