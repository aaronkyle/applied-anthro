summary:

The term **<dt><dfn id="development sudies">development sudies</dfn><dt>** refers to <dd>an interdisciplinary concentration whose main mission is to provide students with the knowledge, critical perspectives and skills they need to engage with the issues and problems of national and international development, especially as they relate to the Global South.</dd> The concentration draws from a range of disciplines, but is particularly grounded in the social sciences: anthropology, sociology, political science, history and economics. Concentrators combine courses that offer local and historical knowledge of specific areas of the developing world, with those that explore transnational dimensions of development.

Development studies is a multidisciplinary branch of social science.

Development studies is offered as a specialised Master's degree in a number of universities, and, less commonly, as an undergraduate degree. It has grown in popularity as a subject of study since the early 1990s, and has been most widely taught and researched in the third world and in countries with a colonial history, such as the UK, where development studies originated.[1]

Students of development studies often choose careers in international organisations such as the United Nations or the World Bank, non-governmental organisations, private sector development consultancy firms, and research centres.

## Professional Bodies

Throughout the world, a number of professional bodies for Development Studies have been founded:[2]

* Europe: European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI)
* Latin America: Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO)
* Asia: Asian Political and International Studies Association (APISA)
* Africa: Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) and Organization for Social Science Research in Eastern and Southern Africa (OSSREA)
* Arabic world: Arab Institutes and Centres for Economic and Social Development Research (AICARDES)
* India: Centre For Social Entrepreneurship & Corporate Social Responsibility at Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India [3]

The common umbrella organisation of these association is the Inter-regional Coordinating Committee of Development Associations (ICCDA).

In the UK and Ireland, the Development Studies Association is a major source of information for research on and studying in development studies. Its mission is to connect and promote those working on development research.

## History

The emergence of development studies as an academic discipline in the second half of the twentieth century is in large part due to increasing concern about economic prospects for the third world after decolonisation. In the immediate post-war period, development economics, a branch of economics, arose out of previous studies in colonial economics. By the 1960s, an increasing number of development economists felt that economics alone could not fully address issues such as political effectiveness and educational provision.[4] Development studies arose as a result of this, initially aiming to integrate ideas of politics and economics. Since then, it has become an increasingly inter- and multi-disciplinary subject, encompassing a variety of social scientific fields.[5] In recent years the use of political economy analysis- the application of the analytical techniques of economics- to try and assess and explain political and social factors that either enhance or limit development has become increasingly widespread as a way of explaining the success or failure of reform processes. The era of modern development is commonly deemed to have commenced with the inauguration speech of Harry S. Truman in 1949. In Point Four of his speech, with reference to Latin America and other poor nations, he said that "for the first time in history, humanity possess[ed] the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.".[6] But development studies has since also taken an interest in lessons of past development experiences of Western countries.

More recently, the emergence of human security – a new, people-oriented approach to understanding and addressing global security threats – has led to a growing recognition of a relationship between security and development. Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies.
