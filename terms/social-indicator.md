A **social indicator** is a value measured when conducting systematic evaluateion of community life or when performance targets and auditing criteria. Social indicators are used in the analysis of a range of concerns such as those related to safety and healthiness of a person's living or work environment, quality of educational activities and facilities, infrastructure availability and integrity, capacity of governance, etc.

Social development practitioners face many challenges when attempting to gather and analyse social indicator data for any given project initiative.

It should be relatively straight forward to locate a commonly-accepted basket of macro (i.e. state-level) “social indicators”.

Even this step is problematic.

What constitutes “social indicators data”? How can “social indictors” be grouped and analyzed?

Are there sufficient social indicators data for testing measuring if broadly-defined social development goals are being achieved?

One tricky aspect of attempting to resolve ‘if’ appropriate social indicators data is available for measuring progress towards social development goals is to define parameters for ‘social indicators’ [and ‘social development’ more broadly].


What sorts of proxies can be used to assess how population dynamics (such as “community health”, “livelihoods”, or even less ambiguous parameters such as “social welfare”) respond to development initiatives?

Increaingly, international financial institions are contributing to scholarship and cannons of [policy on social analysis](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTSR/Resources/SocialAnalysisSourcebookFINAL2003Dec.pdf) and to making 'indicator data' (including measures of social well-being available) for public consumption (e.g. development studies research).

 wealth and diversity of existing datasets

A macro-level (i.e. global) study of the change in social indicators might be able to inform social scientists about some very rough trends in social development, but is unlikely to shed much light on questions about the causation of change (or lack thereof) demonstrated amongst and across different indicator sets.  Single case studies in which different regions are compared and analyzed (especially in cases where different social development programmes have been tested and implemented) might offer greater insight into the relationship between policy and programme-initiatives and different social indicators, the “lessons learned” from these studies might not apply where social, political, and economic conditions differ. 


Certain data are difficult to locate—especially specific measures for the success of particular, institutionally-defined developmental policy objectives, such as those of the Asian Development Bank pertaining to indigenous peoples’ development goals

Most 'local-level' social indicator data must be processed in order to be useful in social analysis. The macro-level data collated, maintained and disseminated by the large international financers has a rather limited range of application for analysing the ramifications of a particular initiative.


The World Bank publishes numerous helpful guidance notes that show how indicator data can factor into social analysis: [A User’s Guide to Poverty and Social Impact Analysis](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPSIA/Resources/490023-1121114603600/12685_PSIAUsersGuide_Complete.pdf)

My experience at the Asian Development Bank also suggests that the multilateral development banks are not working with their clients to systematically assemble common sets of social indicator data.

While it may be possible that some corporations maintain systematically-organized registers of socio-economic data and that they work on an on-going basis to compare and evaluate data across space and time, the management and staff of those few (albeit major) clients for whom I have worked in the rarely were able to produce these data on request&mdash;even in those few instances when I was engaged to help evaluate portfilios of past and on-going project to inform policy studies.

Another complicating factors is that of time.

Social indicator data—when available—are commonly reported as one-year aggregates.

While such data may be applied to determining general, long-term trends, they can obscure equally significant short-term variable fluctuations.  For instance, while it might be possible that an agricultural technology investment project in a particular township is helping to generate increasingly more grain outputs year-over-year, it may also be the case that this increase in grain production is only helping local farmers to eat more for 3 months per year—for the remainder of the time, farmers starve equally as in years past.  In this case, do our social indicators accurately describe positive and sustained social development, or do they mask the reality that little in changing for how the local community experiences hunger?

Many governments and some private-sector instutions are also leading efforts to indicators to measure social performance of developmental interventions.

But it is only relatively recently that states, civil society and agents of the market been working together to identify proxies that can be used to assess how population dynamics change in response to development initiatives (e.g. issues changing community health and health services, livelihoods composition, acccess to resources).

Measuring and quantifying “social development” is a tricky affair.


, some good follow-up research questions with regard to available data are:

Would it make sense to examine data from a single country in an attempt to examine if social development goals are being achieved? Would it make sense to do a comparative study or two or more countries?

1.  How similar are the data presented?
2.  Does most information appear to come from the same sources? 
3.  How robust are the datasets?
4.  What information appears to be lacking?

Beyond the data, are our current tools of analysis adequate for understanding processes of social development?  How might they be changed and improved?

What sorts of time-frames should be used when measuring social development?
