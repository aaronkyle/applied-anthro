An area where traditional land-use patterns have created and maintained landscape features that reflect a particular culture, life-way, or historical time period which merits consideration as a heritage resource. An historic landscape may include historic monuments and archaeological sites as well. Integrity and uniqueness are most relevant for judging the importance of this type of resource. While an historic landscape may share aspects of an historic district, the term typically refers to a non-urban area with heritage value. This resource type may also include culturally important natural features such as sacred lakes, forests and waterfalls. Sacred trees, for instance, are common in Africa.
