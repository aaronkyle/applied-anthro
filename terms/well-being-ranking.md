A *well-being ranking* (see also *wealth ranking*) is used to define relative well-being according to classifications of a community’s socio-economic structure and their livelihood priorities. Community members are asked to defines what they believe to be indicators of well-being, wealth and poverty (e.g., income, land, animals, credit, family structure, number of children) and then to rank households within the community according to these criteria. Well-being rankings are also useful for learning about values associated to different livelihood practices and notions of vulnerability.  Community measures of wealth and well-being can be used also when defining a baseline against which future intervention impacts can be measured. Ranking exercises identify and rank needs, community priorities, and problem.
