An **environmental and social management framework (ESMF)** refers to an instrument that examines the
risks and impacts when a project consists of a program and/or series of sub-projects, and those risks and
impacts cannot be determined until the program or sub-project details have been identified. The ESMF sets out the principles, rules, guidelines and procedures to assess the environmental and social impacts. It contains measures and plans to reduce, mitigate and/or offset adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts, provisions for estimating and budgeting the costs of such measures, and information on the agency or agencies responsible for addressing project impacts.

The term "Environmental Management Framework" or "EMF" may be equivalent to ESMF in certain contexts.
