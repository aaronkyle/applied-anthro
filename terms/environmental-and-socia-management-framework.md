An **environmental and social management framework (ESMF)** sets out the principles, rules, guidelines and procedures to assess the environmental and social impacts. It contains measures and plans to reduce, mitigate and/or offset adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts, provisions for estimating and budgeting the costs of such measures, and information on the agency or agencies responsible for addressing project impacts.

The term "Environmental Management Framework" or "EMF" may be equivalent to ESMF in certain contexts.
