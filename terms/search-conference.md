A '''Search Conference''' is a conference organized by the project operator where issues pertaining to the project in question are discussed, particularly in connection with a mutually envisioned goal or desired outcome for the project. Participants are recruited through a 'snowballing' method: practitioners ask around to identify the experts in a particular field, and recruits them based on the strengths they will bring to the process.

Search conferences are generally conducted in the early stages of the planning process, usually with a relatively small groups people (15-30) meeting once over one or two days. Participants discuss and forecast a possible scenario and pose questions to one another about how that future might be achieved or avoided. The discussions seek to draw example issues from a broad perspective, and then ‘work backward’ to develop action plans toward realizing a desired outcome—as collaboratively defined.


Typical features of a search conference include:

* gathering feedback from a small, knowledgeable and non-representative group;
* building on individual strengths for a collectively well-defined concept
* constructive and collaborative knowledge sharing;
* implementable over a 1 or 2 day period.

Advantages of organizing search conferences is that small teams can be organized around a particular issue, and the commonalities differences in the skills and knowledge individual constituents can help to ensure that many different aspects of any potential future outcome are taken into account through a collective and participatory planning process. Search conferences are results-orientated. A search conference is, however, not a substitute for broader community consultation about potential risks and impacts.
