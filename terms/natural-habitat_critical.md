Critical natural habitats are:

(i)  existing protected areas and areas officially proposed by governments as protected areas (e.g., reserves that meet the criteria of the World Conservation Union [IUCN] classifications2), areas initially recognized as protected by traditional local communities (e.g., sacred groves), and sites that maintain conditions vital for the viability of these protected areas (as determined by the environ-mental assessment process3); or

(ii) sites identified on supplementary lists prepared by the Bank or an authoritative source determined by the Regional environment sector unit (RESU).  Such sites may include areas recognized by traditional local communities (e.g., sacred groves); areas with known high suitability for bio-diversity conservation; and sites that are critical for rare, vulnerable, migratory, or endangered species.4 Listings are based on systematic evaluations of such factors as species richness; the degree of endemism, rarity, and vulnerability of component species; representativeness; and integrity of ecosystem processes.

Certain natural habitats are defined as being 'critical' if they are: (i) existing protected areas and areas officially proposed by government as protected areas, areas initially recognized as protected by traditional local communities and sites that maintain conditions vital for the viability of these protected areas or (ii) sites identified on supplemental lists prepared by the Bank or an authoritative source determined by the regional environment divisions. In this regard: the Bank does not support projects that, in the Bank's opinion, involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats.
