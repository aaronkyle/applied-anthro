In policy, terminology is important. Comparative analysis of social policy is a particularly challenging topic for maintaining terminological clarity and consistency. Over the years, I have worked to develop my own definitions for terms used in social policy (a defining feature of the [applied-anthro](http://applied-anthro.com/) website) to ensure clarity and continuity in my writing. This lexicon is influenced by the IFI definitions, but it is adapted to accomodate discussion of broad phenomenological concerns.

Consider the following:

Most IFIs compile some form of **operations manual** comprised of policies for effecting the mandates of their institutional charters. In addition to board-approved policies and regulations, some IFI **operations manuals** also include notes of guidance for bank staff and clients that elaborate on the intended meaning of policy provisions to facilitate better implementation.

For example, while the Asian Development Bank's operations manual refers only to policies (which the ADB terms **operational procedures**, or OPs), the operations manual of the World Bank contains **operational policies** (OPs), **bank procedures** (BPs), **directives**, as well as interim instructions to staff (referred to OpMemos).

It can be hard to distinguish 'policy' from 'guidance', and still more difficult to discern what is "required" as opposed to that which is simply "recommended" (a question that my clients often pose when considering my recommendations for policy implementation).

It can also be challenging to identify the range of social policy that may be applicable to a given project or development initiative.

In recent years, **safeguards policies** have been receiving considerable media attention as IFIs continue to invest time and resources in updating their safeguard policy frameworks. Yet safeguards are but one aspect of **social policy**.  Other aspects include **social development policy** (including initiatives to mainstream gender-sensitive development; initiatives to ensure the participation and empowerment of people and communities affected by development processes), **social protection policy** (including social assistance and welfare service programs including child protection and micro- and area based schemes to address poverty, and vulnerability; social insurance programs to cushion risks associated with unemployment, ill-health, disability, work-related injury and old age; and labour market policies and programs designed to generate employment, improve working conditions), **human rights law**, etc. Unfortunately, IFI institutional treatments of social issues (such as web and print publications touting institutional contributions to social development) seldom help to situate different institutional initiatives and activities within their greater policy contexts.

Adding an additional layer of complexity to any discussion of 'social policy' among international financial institutions (IFIs) are those policies that have an apparent 'social' orientation, but which are operational policies that come to bear only on internal bank operations.
