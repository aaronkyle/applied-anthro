summary:
-->

  * Historic sites are generally aboveground architectural features (e.g., house, temple, market place, church) that have reached a designated age or have other characteristics that make them ‘historic’ and therefore worthy of consideration as a heritage resource. As with pre-historic archaeological sites, the importance of an historic structure will vary according to age, type and condition. Some historic structures may have associated archaeological deposits. An historic structure may be abandoned or occupied. Historical sites may include structures that are still in use. Location and design of historical sites may point to environmental changes over time, including changes in sea level, vegetation, and hunting and agricultural practices.  Historical sites may also be indicative of the introduction of new technologies to the area. A feature such as metallurgy, mortars, arches and vaulting, industrial architecture, etc. can be documented and understood by studying artefacts and earlier historical structures. 


Subtypes:

1. historical sites
  * historic roads, bridges, dams and other water works, fortifications, and walls; may also include engineering and industrial sites, (train stations, early woolen mills)

5. historic parks and gardens
  * Returning gardens to their original appearance may require research into plant materials.

6. trade routes monuments and remains
  * Remains of ancient trade routes document early trade relations and cultural connections. Trading patterns, often over long distances, are revealed in archaeological finds such as ceramics, metalwork, coins, or paleobotanical evidence.

2. submerged or marine sites
  * ancient coastal settlements; sunken ships
  * Can be encountered during the construction phase of projects. Usually identified either as chance encounters or using new techniques of marine exploration.
