Open ended, discursive engagement with targeted stakeholder groups wherein a facilitator guides the conversations on specific topics of interest to gain a deeper understanding of respondents' attitudes and opinions. A key feature is that participants are able interact with, and react to, one another—opening a forum for the sharing of insights and data that are less likely to be accessed via one-on-one interviews.

The role of the facilitator in conducting a FGD is to create an environment in which stakeholders feel comfortable—providing a safe space where all participants have the chance to express their ideas and feelings freely."
