A **non-government organization** is a legally constituted entity that operates independently from the government. The term normally refers to citizen-based associations that are not conventional for-profit businessesâ€”usually those that pursue wider social aims that have political aspects, but are not openly political organizations (such as political parties). The World Bank classifies NGOs as either operational NGOs, which are primarily concerned with development projects, or advocacy NGOs, which are primarily concerned with promoting a cause.

In some cases, NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments. In such cases, non-governmental status is maintained by excluding government representatives from membership in the organization.
