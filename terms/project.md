acquire new facilities, and investment funds or financial intermediaries with existing portfolios of assets and/or

A Project is a development in any sector at an identified location. It includes an expansion or upgrade of an existing operation that results in a material change in output or function. Examples of Projects that trigger the Equator Principles include, but are not limited to; a power plant, mine, oil and gas Projects, chemical plant, infrastructure development, manufacturing plant, large scale real estate development, real estate development in a Sensitive Area, or any other Project that creates
significant environmental and/or social risks and impacts. In the case of Export Credit Agency supported transactions, the new commercial, infrastructure or industrial undertaking to which the export is intended will be considered the Project.<ref>http://www.equator-principles.com/resources/equator_principles_III.pdf</ref>
