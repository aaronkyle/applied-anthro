**Participant Observation** is a method widely used by anthropologists. It typically requires the researcher to get involved in the kinds of social activities, events, and networks that are central to peopleâ€™s lives and experiences, in an attempt to see and understand the world through their eyes. It involves both participating in the community or activity, and observing the participation of others.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004">Payne, Geoffrey; Majale, Michael (eds). 2004.

Participant observation is useful for accessing information that participants would not normally be willing to discuss in an interview setting, for example because that information is sensitive or too mundane to be considered important. It can also be used to gain more details of interactions, events or processes than can be gained from interviews or questionnaires. Though there may be many spaces in which observers are prohibited such as in government or business.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004" /> 

Though it has many strengths, participant observation is one of the most demanding methods in terms of time and effort. It may even require months or years of intensive work because the researcher needs to become an accepted part of the community or culture to assure that the observations are of natural behaviors and structures. However, it is important to recognize and acknowledge the ways in which the presence and participation of the researcher affects events and observed behavior. This is something that can never be fully avoided. Participant observation also often relies on subjective interpretations and measurements and may involve unsystematic gathering of data. However, there are other forms of observation that can be used which involve lower levels of participation and time such as casual observation, attendance at events, structured observations such as counting the number of houses with electricity, or visiting field sites.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004" /> 

While undertaking participatory observation it is important to record impressions and observations, both general and specific, as well as writing down the observer's own feelings and emotions of the experiences. This can be done by taking mental or quick scratch notes during the experience and then elaborating these notes in a diary at a later stage.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004" /> 

In the context of research on regulatory guidelines, participatory observation can be used for the researcher to gain first-hand experience of what is involved e.g. in accessing legal housing. In the Bolivian research project on regulatory guidelines for new development, Fabian Farfan decided to follow the local administrative procedures to gain a clearer understanding of the costs (both direct and indirect) of time and money involved in the process, and the frustrations and barriers these can represent.<ref name="Payne et. al 2004" />
