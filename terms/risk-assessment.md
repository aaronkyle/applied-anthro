Risk assessment: An instrument for estimating the probability of harm occurring from the presence of dangerous conditions or materials at a project site.  Risk represents the likelihood and significance of a potential hazard being realized; therefore, a hazard assessment often precedes a risk assessment, or the two are conducted as one exercise.  Risk assessment is a flexible method of analysis, a systematic approach to organizing and analyzing scientific information about potentially hazardous activities or about substances that might pose risks under specified conditions. The Bank routinely requires risk assessment for projects involving handling, storage, or disposal of hazardous materials and waste, the construction of dams, or major construction works in locations vulnerable to seismic activity or other potentially damaging natural events.  For certain projects, the EA report may consist of the risk assessment alone; in other cases, the risk assessment is part of the EA documentation.
