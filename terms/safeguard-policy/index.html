=== Safeguard Policies and Performance Standards === 

''Adapted from'': http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-565324

Starting as a loose assembly of internal staff policies adopted by international financial institutions in the 1980s, safeguard policies are framework declarations of explicitly-defined lending requirements to protect people and the environment from the adverse effects of project operations and development initiatives. The World Bank (IBRD and IDA), Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank all currently have such Safeguard Policies in place for investment projects and programme lending (although not for development policy lending (DPL) or reform programmes, which have separate relevant policies; see Update 66).  The Performance Standards of the International Financial Corporation (adopted as the basis of the Equator Principles) and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development can also be considered to be “safeguard policies” [DIFFER ; (see Update 67).]

The safeguards consist of ten key environmental and social policies that set standards and procedures that the borrower and Bank must follow in the lead up to and during World Bank-financed projects. 

The ten safeguards are:

*   Environmental assessment - The 'umbrella policy' through which potential social and environmental impacts are identified and mitigation measures proposed.
*   Natural habitats - places limits on Bank financed projects that may impact on areas of important biodiversity.
*   Pest management - promotes the use of biological or environmental control methods and sets conditions on the acquisition and use of pesticides.
*   Indigenous peoples - establishes standards and procedures when projects affect indigenous communities, it is the only safeguard to in some way reference human rights.
*   Involuntary resettlement - sets standards and procedures for projects that displace people from their homes or cause economic displacement;
*   Forestry - establishes minimum standards on the types of forest projects that the Bank will finance, including commercial logging and plantations under restricted conditions.
*   Safety of dams - establishes procedures and safety requirements for construction of new dams and for projects that depend on safe functioning of existing large dams.
*   Projects on international waterways - seeks to reduce potential conflict between states that border an international waterway over projects that may pollute it.
*   Projects in disputed areas - lays out minimum rules for Bank-financing of projects in areas disputed by two or more states.
*   Cultural property - requires the Bank to avoid damage and assist in the preservation of cultural property.


The [http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/enviro.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/pol_PerformanceStandards2006_full/$FILE/IFC+Performance+Standards.pdf Performance Standards] are grouped into eight sections, each of which is coupled with [[IFC Guidance Notes to Performance Standards | Guidance Notes]] to further clarify client roles and responsibilities under the standards. The eight [http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/PerformanceStandards Performance Standards](PS) are:

* PS 1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management System
* PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions
* PS 3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement
* PS 4: Community Health Safety and Security
* PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement
* PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management
* PS 7: Indigenous Peoples
* PS 8: Cultural Heritage

Prior to financing, a proposed project is subject to a social and environmental review during which potential impacts are identified and remediation measures proposed. In reviewing the potential impact of projects, the World Bank and the IFC use a categorisation system that identifies which safeguards are triggered and what level of action or precaution must be taken. 

Projects are rated from category A, the highest risk, down to category C, the lowest.

When the World Bank or a borrower is alleged to be violating any safeguard, complaints can be lodged through the Inspection Panel, a semi-independent body formed in 1993 that enables affected parties to request an investigation into the Bank's role in projects (see Update 34).

IFC clients must address project-related grievances or complaints from affected parties. Complainants can allege violations of safeguards and approach the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, an internal watchdog that reports directly to the president of the World Bank Group (see Update 34).

…are based on international agreements, even if these protections are not explicitly provided for in the borrower country's national law.&nbsp;

## Safeguards in the public sector


### World Bank

http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTSAFEPOL/0,,menuPK:584441~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:584435,00.html

The World Bank regards environmental and social safeguard policies as a cornerstone of its sustainable poverty reduction framwork. The objective of safeguard policies is to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. These policies provide guidelines for bank staff and for clients in the identification, preparation, and implementation of project operations.

The Work Bank safeguard policies emphasise that adverse impacts are avoided, or where not feasible, minimized or mitigated (Do No Harm). They also call for the participation of stakeholders in project design and play an important role in building ownership among affected peoples. The World Bank claims that effectiveness and development impact of client projects and programs has substantially increased as a result of attention to these policies. [1]

The current safeguard policies of international financial institutions can be found [here](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/EXTLACREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20547266~menuPK:1308602~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:847655,00.html
).


#### Indigenous Peoples

The World Bank policy on indigenous peoples, Operational Directive (OD) 4.10: Indigenous Peoples

Indigenous Peoples safeguards emphasise that borrowers and Bank staff the need to screen communities in the project area of impact to identify communities meeting the Bank's criteria for "indigenous peoples", to consult with them, and to ensure that they participate in and benefit from the development process.


#### Involuntary Resettlement

The implementation of development projects that require land may cause involuntary displacement of population who live in affected areas. The involuntary displacement may cause severe long-term impacts unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out. Therefore, since 1980 the Bank has developed policies and guidelines for resettlement of project's affected population. The Bank's Resettlement Policy has been modified several times according to the experiences in its application and to the new situations that have emerged. Currently, the olicy in force is the Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12. The main objective of this policy isto assist the efforts of the displaced persons to improve their livelihoods and standards, or at least to restore them to pre-displacement levels.

Generally, the projects that may cause involuntary displacement are: infrastructure projects (for instance: dams, roads, water supply and sanitation), management of natural resources, slum upgrading and risk prevention (people who live in areas at prune risk). In the first two types of projects the displacement in a precondition for the implementation of the project whereas the last two kinds of projects the resettlement is a vehicle to improve the living conditions of the population.

In the Latin American and the Caribbean Region, the unplanned growth of cities has generated large deficits in housing, transportation infrastructure, and basic services, especially water and sewage systems. Currently, 75 percent of the population lives in cities. According to this situation, 85 percent of the Bank's financed projects that imply resettlement are in the sectors of urban development, water supply, sanitation and urban transportation, and the 95 percent of the displaced population are located in cities. The projects on urban development, water supply and sanitation lead to an improvement in housing and environment for the residents as well as for the resettled population. For that reason, 80 percent of the displaced population is being resettled for its own benefit, and not as a precondition for development of a project. In this way, resettlement has become a strategy for reducing poverty and a means to reduce levels of housing informality in Latin American cities.

### Strategy

The Bank has carried out a review of the projects it finances in the region and, according to the results, prepares guidelines for the application of the Resettlement Policy. In addition, a guideline for urban resettlement based on the lessons learned in the region is under preparation. It has also been planned to develop guidelines on resettlement and natural resources management, and resettlement for disaster prevention.

### Inter-American Development Bank (IADB / IDB)

[IDB distinguishes between two main categories of safeguards:](http://www.iadb.org/en/insitutional-reforms/better-environmental-and-social-safeguards,1830.html "Better Environmental and Social Safeguards")

#### Environmental safeguards

The IDB adopted its [Environment and Safeguard Compliance Policy in 2006](http://www.iadb.org/news-releases/2010-02/english/idb-boosts-access-accountability-with-new-policy-for-communities-to-voice-concer-6531.html)--calling for safeguard-compliant project designs. To help implement the new policy, in 2007 the IDB created the Environmental Safeguards Unit to help build institutional knowledge and expertise on environmental management. [The IDB was the first multilateral development bank to integrate climate change impacts as part of environmental analysis of key sectors.] In 2009, IDB established an [independent advisory group](http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/sustainability/sustainability-report,1510.html) to provide an independent review and make recommendations to increase policy effectiveness. It also began an [unprecedented process to limit the greenhouse gas emissions of the projects it finances](http://www.iadb.org/en/news/news-releases/2009-11-05/idb-launches-process-to-limit-climate-impact-of-projects-it-finances,5889.html), and endorsed the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which seeks greater transparency and accountability in contracts and payments in extractive industries. IDB also launched sustainability scorecards for [biofuel](http://www.iadb.org/news/detail.cfm?language=English&id=5617) and [tourism](http://www.iadb.org/news-releases/2009-05/english/idb-releases-sustainability-scorecard-for-private-sector-tourism-projects-5426.html) projects.

#### Social safeguards

IDB establishes three main areas of social safeguards: 1) Indigenous Peoples Policy, 2) Involuntary Resettlement Policy, 3) Operational Policy on Gender Equality.


##### Indigenous Peoples

The IDB operational guidelines (2006) and policy (2007) for Indigenous Peoples.

The Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples requires that the IDB safeguard indigenous peoples' rights are considered in all aspets of Bank operations and lending portfolio.

Specific goals are to foster development appropriate to the economy and governance of indigenous peoples, to safeguard territorial and cultural integrity, and to preserve a harmonious relationship between people and the natural environment. The Operating Guidelines for the Indigenous Peoples Policy (IPP) was approved in 2006.



The IDB begain the the process to update its existing Women in Development Policy in 2009.

...Operational policy on Gender, ??once approved??, will make the IDB the first multilateral development institution with safeguards for gender equality. http://www.iadb.org/en/insitutional-reforms/better-environmental-and-social-safeguards,1830.html


##### Involuntary Resettlement Policy

Covers any project financed by the Bank that involves the involuntary physical displacement of people living in the area. The goal is to minimize physical and economic disruption. If people must be displaced, the policy requires that pre-project conditions be established and, where possible, that displaced people share in project benefits. The policy also defines the scope and criteria of resettlement plans. The Involuntary Resettlement in IDB Projects: Principles and Guidelines document was approved in 1999.

##### Operational Policy on Gender Equality in Development

Takes into account the Bank's experience supporting the integration of women as leaders, participants, and beneficiaries in development; reflects gains in the region in terms of the status of women and gender equality, as well as emerging challenges; integrates a gender perspective that seeks equal conditions and opportunities for women and men to reach their social, economic, political, and cultural potential; and sets out specific mechanisms for ensuring effective implementation of the Policy and the evaluation of its results. This policy was approved on November 13, 2010.

<h2>Safeguards in the private sector</h2>
<h3>Equator Banks  (Equator Banks)</h3>
<h3>Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund  (CEPF)</h3>
<p>Founded in 2000, the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund is a global leader in enabling civil society to participate in and benefit from conserving some of the world’s most critical ecosystems.</p>
<p>We provide grants for nongovernmental and private sector organizations to help protect biodiversity hotspots, Earth’s most biologically rich yet threatened areas.</p>
<p>The convergence of critical areas for conservation with millions of people who are impoverished and highly dependent on healthy ecosystems for their survival is more evident in the hotspots than anywhere else.</p>
<p>Enabling a stronger voice, influence and action by civil societies is the hallmark of our approach. Our support equips civil society groups to conserve their environment and influence decisions that affect lives, livelihoods and, ultimately, the global environment for the benefit of all. Grant recipients range from small farming cooperatives and community associations to private sector partners and international organizations.</p>
<p>Our grants:</p>
<p>Target biodiversity hotspots in developing and transitional countries.
Are guided by regional investment strategies developed with stakeholders.
Go directly to civil society groups to build this vital constituency for conservation alongside governmental partners.
Create working alliances among diverse groups, combining unique capacities and eliminating duplication of efforts.
Achieve results through an ever-expanding network of partners working together toward shared goals.</p>
<p>http://www.cepf.net/grants/Pages/safeguard_policies.aspx
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ASSESSMENT PROCESS</p>
<p>The CEPF project proposal forms seek out several elements of the basic project design including objectives, performance indicators and sustainability issues. Within these applications are a series of safeguard questions that must be answered based on the World Bank’s standard Environmental Assessment. For each, grantees are asked to provide a supporting statement to justify their answer.</p>
<p>CEPF will assess these during the initial proposal review. This review may be deemed satisfactory, or may involve further discussion with the potential grantee. In some cases, additional information may be required for further review and discussion. Throughout the review process, CEPF will maintain contact with the potential grantee to obtain clarification on information provided and request any additional information and documentation needed. In conducting the preliminary evaluation, CEPF will focus on analyzing the materials provided by the potential grantee to determine the following aspects related to the environmental and social effects of the project:</p>
<p>Compliance with CEPF and World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies
Potential for the project to cause adverse environmental impacts
Potential for the project to cause adverse social impacts
Capacity of the applicant to implement any required safeguard-related measures during the preparation and implementation of the project.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the initial screening, CEPF will identify any environmental and social effects of the project and define any safeguard requirements necessary. For projects above $20,000, a more detailed Project Proposal Application is required, and safeguard requirements may be further elaborated and defined. The grantee is responsible for implementation and monitoring of any required safeguard instrument or other required measures to address Safeguard Policies.</p>
<p>This process is then tracked throughout project implementation similar to the tracking of performance toward project objectives. At each performance reporting stage, grantees will revisit the safeguard policy issues to reconfirm their status, adjust any that may have changed during implementation, and make necessary mitigation steps as needed. In cases where grantees are implementing mitigation actions, they will report on the progress of such implementation similar to that which they are doing for other project elements. The intent of this process is to ensure that the environmental and social safeguard issues are continually monitored and mitigated throughout project implementation.</p>
<p>The final step is to evaluate the environmental and social issues at project completion. Any related documents and lessons learned will be shared via www.cepf.net to help in the design and mitigation of negative environmental and social impacts in future projects.</p>

'''Safeguard Policies and Performance Standards'''

''Adapted from'': http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-565324

Starting as a loose assembly of internal staff policies adopted by international financial institutions in the 1980s, safeguard policies are framework declarations of explicitly-defined lending requirements to protect people and the environment from the adverse effects of project operations and development initiatives. The World Bank (IBRD and IDA), Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank all currently have such Safeguard Policies in place for investment projects and programme lending (although not for development policy lending (DPL) or reform programmes, which have separate relevant policies; see Update 66).  The Performance Standards of the International Financial Corporation (adopted as the basis of the Equator Principles) and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development can also be considered to be “safeguard policies” [DIFFER ; (see Update 67).]

The safeguards consist of ten key environmental and social policies that set standards and procedures that the borrower and Bank must follow in the lead up to and during World Bank-financed projects. 

The ten safeguards are:

*   Environmental assessment - The 'umbrella policy' through which potential social and environmental impacts are identified and mitigation measures proposed.

The [http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/enviro.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/pol_PerformanceStandards2006_full/$FILE/IFC+Performance+Standards.pdf Performance Standards] are grouped into eight sections, each of which is coupled with [[IFC Guidance Notes to Performance Standards | Guidance Notes]] to further clarify client roles and responsibilities under the standards. The eight [http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/PerformanceStandards Performance Standards](PS) are:

* PS 1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management System
* PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions
* PS 3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement
* PS 4: Community Health Safety and Security
* PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement
* PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management
* PS 7: Indigenous Peoples
* PS 8: Cultural Heritage

Prior to financing, a proposed project is subject to a social and environmental review during which potential impacts are identified and remediation measures proposed. In reviewing the potential impact of projects, the World Bank and the IFC use a categorisation system that identifies which safeguards are triggered and what level of action or precaution must be taken.
