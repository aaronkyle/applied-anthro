While there is no universally accepted definition of '''Rapid Rural Appraisal''' (RRA), it is often described as a systematic, semi-structured field activity by a multidisciplinary team, designed to obtain new information and formulate new hypotheses regarding rural life. RRA emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the team, as it should have a wide representation of skills and tools at its disposal.<ref name="FAO">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). n.d. “Chapter 8: Rapid Rural Appraisal,” ''Marketing Research and Information Systems'' [Web page].

Techniques for implementing rapid rural appraisal include:

*techniques for designing interview and question formats for individual, household and key informant interviews;
*methods to cross-check information originating from different sources;
*sampling techniques that can be adapted to a particular objective;
*methods for gathering quantitative data within a short time frame;
*methods of direct observation on-site; and
*the use of secondary data sources.<ref name="FAO" />
