### The Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982

101. The acquisition of private land/property for a public purpose is governed by the
Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (ARIPO), 1982 (Ordinance II of
1982 with its subsequent amendments up to 1994). The ordinance supersedes earlier laws
including the Land Acquisition Law of 1894 and others that have been in force between 1947
and 1982. The Ordinance, however, excludes the acquisition of properties used by the public for
the purpose of religious worship, graveyards and cremation grounds.

102. The Ministry of Land (MOL) has the overall responsibility to enforce land acquisition.
The MOL delegates some of its authority to the Commissioner at the Divisional level and
to the Deputy Commissioner at the District level. The Deputy Commissioners (DCs) are
empowered by the MOL to process land acquisition under the Ordinance and pay
compensation to the legal owners of the acquired property. The burden to establish
his/her legal rights to the acquired property in order to be eligible for compensation
under the law is on the landowner. The DC is empowered to acquire a maximum of 50
standard bigha (6.75 ha) of land without any litigation for which he would obtain the
approval of the Divisional Commissioner. Acquisition of land exceeding 50 standard
bigha has to be approved from the central land allocation committee (CLAC) headed by the
chief executive of the Government of Bangladesh. In the case of acquiring Khas land
(government owned land), the land will be transferred through an inter-ministerial meeting
following an acquisition proposal submitted to DC or MOL. The process of land acquisition as
stipulated in the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 is as
follows.

### 6.2 Valuation of Assets and Payment of Compensation


103. The ARIPO provides for the payment of compensation for land and other assets
permanently acquired, including standing crops, trees, and houses and any other damages
caused by such acquisition. The DC determines the market value of acquired assets as per its
value on the date issue of the notice of acquisition (Section 3 Notice), based on the
registered value of similar property bought and/or sold in the area over the preceding 12
months. The market value of the property determined by the DC is reinforced with
additional 50% premium (other than crops) due to compulsory nature of acquisition. The
law specifies methods for calculation of market value of property based on recorded prices
obtained from relevant Government departments such as Registrar (for land), Public Works
Department (for structures), Department of Forests (for trees), Department of Agriculture (for
crops) and Department of Fisheries (for fish stock). The following factors will be considered
by DC in determining the market value of the property to be acquired.

1. The market value of the property at the date of publication of the notice under section 3.
(In determining such market value, the Deputy Commissioner shall take into account the
average value of the properties of similar description and with similar advantages in the
vicinity during the twelve months preceding the date of publication of the notice under
section 3);
2. Damages caused to any standing crops or trees on the property as a result of
acquisition;
3. Any severance of the property from other property held by the interested parties;
4. Any injurious affection on other properties, movable or immovable, in any other manner,
or the earnings of the interested parties;
5. Any possibilities that compel the person interested in the property (to be acquired) to
change his residence or place of business, the reasonable expenses, if any, incidental
to such change; and
6. Any damages that may result from diminution of the profits of the property between the
date of serving the notice under section 6 and the date of taking possession of the
property by the Deputy Commissioner.


### 6.3 The Electricity Act, 1910

104. The Electricity Act was enacted in 1910 to amend the laws relating to the supply and use
of electrical energy. Under this Act, any person can get a license to supply energy and to lay
down or place electric supply lines for the conveyance and transmission of energy. The licensee
can open and break up the soil and pavement of any street, railway or tramway and can lay
down any line or do other work near other utility services (like gas, water, sewer, etc.), provided
prior permission is taken from the respective authority, as stated in Section 12 – 18 of this Act.
According to Section 19 (1) of this Act, the licensee shall pay full compensation to the interested
parties for any damage, detriment or inconvenience caused by him or by anyone employed by
him. Sub- section (1) of Section 51 of the Electricity Rules, 1937 advise that the licensee should
take precautions in laying down electric supply lines near or where any metallic substance or line
crosses in order to avoid electrocution. The Act also provides for a grievance redress
mechanism. Disputes arising from compensation for damages causing from laying electricity
lines will be determined by arbitration [Section 10 (2)].


### 6.4 The Bangladesh Telegraph Act, 1885

105. The Telegraph Act, 1885 does not have any provision for permanent land acquisition for
construction of transmission pillars and lines. The Act provides for the payment of compensation
for temporary impacts resulting from construction of lines and towers. The Act allows for the
removal of any trees that interrupt the transmission lines and would pay compensation only if
those trees existed prior to the installation of the telegraph lines. The Government shall not
acquire any right other than that of user in the property under, over, along, across, in or upon
which the telegraph authority places any telegraph line or posts. Any damages caused to
property during construction, operation and maintenance will be compensated in full to all
persons interested in those properties.

### 6.5 Compliance of the Legal Framework of Bangladesh with ADB Safeguards
Policies

106. The Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) of ADB (2009) includes safeguard requirements
for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous people. The objectives of the
Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard policy are to avoid involuntary resettlement wherever
possible; to minimize involuntary resettlement by exploring project and design alternatives; to
enhance, or at least restore, the livelihoods of all displaced persons in real terms relative to pre-
project levels; and to improve the standards of living of the displaced poor and other vulnerable
groups. The involuntary resettlement safeguards covers physical displacement (relocation, loss
of residential land, or loss of shelter) and economic displacement (loss of land, assets, access
to assets, income sources, or means of livelihoods) as a result of (i) involuntary acquisition of
and, or (ii) involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated parks and
protected areas. It covers them whether such losses and involuntary restrictions are full or
partial, permanent or temporary. The three important elements of ADB’s SPS (2009) are: (i)
compensation at replacement cost for lost assets, livelihoods, and incomes prior to
displacement; (ii) assistance for relocation, including provision of relocation sites with
appropriate facilities and services; and (iii) assistance for rehabilitation to achieve at least the
same level of well-being that affected persons had prior to the project. The SPS gives special
attention to poor and vulnerable households to ensure their improved well-being as a result of
project interventions.

107. The ARIPO provides for the payment of compensation at ‘market value’ for the
properties acquired for development projects. In contrary, the policy principles of SPS
recommend prompt compensation at ‘full replacement cost’ for the lost assets that cannot be
restored. As such, there is a gap between the safeguard requirements of ADB and the national
regulatory framework of Bangladesh. It has been also shown that despite the payment of 50
percent premium over and above the market value of the property together with additional
compensation for any severance and injurious affection causing from land acquisition, statutory
compensation (cash compensation under law-CCL) paid for land is lower than the ‘market
value’ as landowners customarily report lower values during registration to avoid and/or pay
only lower taxes. There are no other national legal or regulatory instruments that stipulate
compensation payments at replacement cost. The gap between the market value and the
replacement value therefore will be filled by the project as provided for in the entitlement matrix
of the RP.

108. The involuntary resettlement policy of ADB emphasizes that displaced persons without
titles to land or any recognizable legal rights to land are eligible for resettlement assistance and
compensation for loss of nonland assets. However, the ARIPO recognizes only the entitlements
of the legal titleholders who are capable of establishing their ownership rights. The Ordinance
does not address the losses of the project-affected persons who do not have titles or ownership
record to their properties such as informal settlers, squatters and occupiers, nor the informal
tenants and lease-holders who are unable to produce any documentary evidence in support of
their properties. Neither the Ordinance provides for any resettlement assistance or transitional
allowances for restoration of the livelihoods of non-titled affected persons. The only exception in
the Ordinance is for bargadar (sharecroppers/tenants) who have cultivated standing crops
under a legally constituted written agreement. These sharecroppers/tenants are entitled to a
part of the compensation money as provided for in the written agreement. Therefore, any
payment of compensation for project affected non-titleholders will be in accordance with the
provisions in the entitlement matrix of the RP, the cost of which will be entirely borne by the
project.

109. ADB’s involuntary resettlement policy recognizes the need for resettlement of physically
and economically displaced persons providing them with needed assistance including secured
tenure to relocation land, better housing at resettlement sites with comparable access to
employment and production opportunities, transitional support and development assistance,
such as land development, credit facilities, training, or employment opportunities and civic
infrastructure and community services, as required. The regulatory framework in Bangladesh
does not provide for such resettlement and rehabilitation assistance for displaced persons. It
only provides for cash compensation for properties acquired. This gap between the safeguards
requirements of ADB and the national regulatory framework will be bridged through a series of
project specific measures built into the RP such as provisions to extend special assistance to
restore and improve the livelihoods of the affected persons including the vulnerable groups
such as elderly and women headed households.

110. The involuntary resettlement policy of ADB recommends adequate and appropriate
replacement land or cash compensation at full replacement cost for lost land. Neither the
Telegraph Act of 1885 nor the Electricity Act of 1910 have any provisions to pay compensation
for the land used for the erection of tower footings of the transmission lines. The Telegraph Act
provides for compensation for the trees fell if those trees were in existence before the telegraph
line was erected. The Electricity Act recognizes full compensation for damage, detriment or
inconvenience caused by project. The authorities will also allow the landowners to cultivate the
land under the transmission tower after they are erected. However, erecting any structures or
planting any tall trees under the towers will be disallowed.


111. Carrying out meaningful consultations with affected persons, host communities, and
concerned nongovernment organizations and establishing a grievance redress mechanism
that would receive and facilitate resolution of the concerns of the affected persons are key
principles of involuntary resettlement policy of ADB. The ARIPO does not make any provisions
for stakeholder consultations or to establish a project based grievance redress mechanism. The
Ordinance provides only a limited space for the affected persons to raise objections to land
acquisition (after section 3 Notice is issued) while disputes over land acquisition have to be
settled through an arbitrator or the courts of law. Therefore, the vacuum for stakeholder
consultations and grievance redress procedures observed in the regulatory framework will be
addressed through the RP.

### 5.2 National Laws and Regulations

52 The principal legal instrument governing land acquisition in Bangladesh is the Acquisition
and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 (subsequent amendments of it
up to 1994). The 1982 Ordinance requires that compensation be paid for (i) land and
assets permanently acquired (including standing crops, trees, houses); and (ii) any other
damages caused by such acquisition. The Ordinance provides certain safeguards for the
owners and has provision for payment of “fair value” for the property acquired. The
Ordinance, however, does not cover Project-affected persons without titles or ownership
record, such as informal settler/squatters, occupiers, and informal tenants and
leaseholders (without document) and does not ensure replacement value of the property
acquired. The Act has no provision of resettlement assistance and transitional
allowances for restoration of livelihoods of the non-titled affected persons.

53 In all cases the deputy commissioners determine ‘market value’ of acquired assets on
the date of notice of acquisition (notice under section 3 of the Ordinance). The DCs then
add 50% premium of the assessed value for cash compensation under law (CCL) of all
acquired assets due to compulsory acquisition. The CCL paid for land is generally less
than the “market value” as owners customarily report lower values during registration to
avoid and/or pay less tax. If land acquired has standing crops cultivated by tenant
(bargadar), under a legally constituted written agreement, the law requires that part of
the compensation money be paid in cash to the tenants as per the agreement. Places of
worship, graveyard and cremation grounds are not to be acquired for any purpose. The
law requires that the salvaged materials upon payment of compensation will be
auctioned out by the Government.
