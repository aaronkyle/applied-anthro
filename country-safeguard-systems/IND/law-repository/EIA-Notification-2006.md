stages, all of which may not apply to particular cases as set forth below in this notification. These
four stages in sequential order are:-
• Stage (1) Screening (Only for Category ‘B’ projects and activities)
• Stage (2) Scoping
• Stage (3) Public Consultation
• Stage (4) Appraisal
I. Stage (1) - Screening:

 In case of Category ‘B’ projects or activities, this stage will entail the scrutiny of an
application seeking prior environmental clearance made in Form 1 by the concerned State level
Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) for determining whether or not the project or activity
requires further environmental studies for preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) for its appraisal prior to the grant of environmental clearance depending up on the nature
and location specificity of the project . The projects requiring an Environmental Impact
Assessment report shall be termed Category ‘B1’ and remaining projects shall be termed
Category ‘B2’ and will not require an Environment Impact Assessment report. For categorization
of projects into B1 or B2 except item 8 (b), the Ministry of Environment and Forests shall issue
appropriate guidelines from time to time.
II. Stage (2) - Scoping:
(i) “Scoping”: refers to the process by which the Expert Appraisal Committee in the case of
Category ‘A’ projects or activities, and State level Expert Appraisal Committee in the case of
Category ‘B1’ projects or activities, including applications for expansion and/or modernization
and/or change in product mix of existing projects or activities, determine detailed and
comprehensive Terms Of Reference (TOR) addressing all relevant environmental concerns for
the preparation of an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report in respect of the project or
activity for which prior environmental clearance is sought. The Expert Appraisal Committee or
State level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned shall determine the Terms of Reference on
the basis of the information furnished in the prescribed application Form1/Form 1A including
Terns of Reference proposed by the applicant, a site visit by a sub- group of Expert Appraisal
Committee or State level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned only if considered necessary by
the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned, Terms
of Reference suggested by the applicant if furnished and other information that may be available
with the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned. All
projects and activities listed as Category ‘B’ in Item 8 of the Schedule
(Construction/Township/Commercial Complexes /Housing) shall not require Scoping and will be
appraised on the basis of Form 1/ Form 1A and the conceptual plan.
(ii) The Terms of Reference (TOR) shall be conveyed to the applicant by the Expert
Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee as concerned within sixty days
of the receipt of Form 1. In the case of Category A Hydroelectric projects Item 1(c) (i) of the
Schedule the Terms of Reference shall be conveyed along with the clearance for pre-construction
activities .If the Terms of Reference are not finalized and conveyed to the applicant within sixty
days of the receipt of Form 1, the Terms of Reference suggested by the applicant shall be
deemed as the final Terms of Reference approved for the EIA studies. The approved Terms of 
5
Reference shall be displayed on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the
concerned State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority.
(iii) Applications for prior environmental clearance may be rejected by the regulatory
authority concerned on the recommendation of the EAC or SEAC concerned at this stage itself.
In case of such rejection, the decision together with reasons for the same shall be communicated
to the applicant in writing within sixty days of the receipt of the application.
III. Stage (3) - Public Consultation:
(i) “Public Consultation” refers to the process by which the concerns of local affected persons
and others who have plausible stake in the environmental impacts of the project or activity are
ascertained with a view to taking into account all the material concerns in the project or activity
