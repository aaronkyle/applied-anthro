### Government Regulation (PP) No. 10 of 2010 re: Procedure of Altering the Appropriation and Function of Forest Areas

SUMMARY

The law makes requirements to the procedure of altering the appropriation and functions of various forest areas, all of which are defined in the first article. The change of either the appropriation or the function(s) of forest areas require taking the socio-economic condition of the communities in or near the forest areas into account. Notably, the law does not contain any requirements for public disclosure.

CONSULTATION

While the law does not contain explicit requirements for public consultation, there are several requirements for which some level of consultation seems assumed to be necessary. For example, changes in appropriation or function(s) of forest areas are required to take the socio-economic condition of communities into account, and these changes must also be made with the public’s aspirations in mind.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Protected Forest is “a forest area whose main function is to protect a life-supporting system to regulate water sources, prevent floods, control erosion, avoid seawater intrusion, and maintain land fertility.”
Production Forest is “a forest area whose main function is to produce forest products.”
Permanent Production Forest is “a forest area with the class of slope, type of soil, and rainfall intensity which, after each of the factors is multiplied by a weighing factor, scores below 125, exclusive of protected forest, wildlife reserve, natural conservation and hunting ground.”
Limited Production Forest is “a forest area with the class of slope, type of soil, and rainfall intensity which, after each of the factors is multiplied by a weighing factor, scores 125-174, exclusive of protected forest, wildlife reserve, natural conservation forest and hunting ground.”
Convertible Production Forest is “a forest area which by space is reserved for development other than forestry activities.”
“Change that has a significant impact, wide scope and strategic value is a change that has an impact on biophysical conditions such as climate change, ecosystem, and water sources, as well as socio-economic impact on the present and future generations.”

Article 2 requires changes in the appropriation and function of forest areas to meet the demand of national development dynamics and public aspirations. This will be done by continuous optimization of distribution functions, by using forest areas in a sustainable and conservable way, and through proportional maintenance of forest areas.

Article 41 states that a change in function within the main function of conservation forests includes changes in, among other things, “hunting ground into nature reserve, wildlife reserve, national park, grand forest park or nature tourist park.” Such changes can only be made if:
a) there has been a change in the biophysical condition of forest areas as a result of natural phenomenon, environmental impact or human activity;
b) an improvement period is needed to optimize the function and utility of forest areas; or
c) the scope of areas is very small and surrounded by the socio-economic environment as a result of development outside forestry activity that does not support the continuation of ecological process naturally.

Article 48 defines a change in the appropriation of forest areas that has a significant impact, wide scope and strategic value as a change in the appropriation of forest areas that has an impact on the biophysical condition of the forest or the socio-economic condition of the community. Impacts on the socio-economic condition of the community, in turn, is a change leading to a decrease or increase in the socio-economic condition of the community for present and future generations. This change can be either influential or not influential, and is based on guidance and criteria provided for in the regulation of the Minister. While not explicitly stated, understanding any potential change to the socio-economic condition of the community will likely involve some levels of public consultation to be accurate.
