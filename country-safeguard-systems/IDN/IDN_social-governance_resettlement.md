**Social Regulatory Authorities.**

With respect to social impacts, in particular land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) for project-affected families, authority resides primarily at the State and local levels.

51. With respect to land acquisition for the construction of sub-stations, four state-level agencies participate in the basic structure of land administration: [^47]

(1) The Land Revenue Department maintains the textual database for land records as well as tax registers;
(2) The Survey and Settlement Department is responsible for maintaining spatial data, mapping and demarcating boundaries, and executing surveys on demand;
(3) The Department of Stamps and Registration is responsible for registering deeds and for collecting stamp duty due on transactions; and
(4) Municipal corporations or Panchayats maintain a property tax register and in some cases also maps, layout plans or city surveys outside of agricultural areas

Of the four agencies, the Land Revenue Department is the key institution, with considerable field presence dating back to pre-independence. At the District level its functions are overseen by the District Collector who is the key counterpart for sector agencies in all land transactions as well as resettlement and rehabilitation. However, due to the gradual decline in the importance of land revenue as a source of government income (from 30% in the late 1950s to less than 2% in the late 1980s, the state Revenue Departments have been burdened with other mandates unrelated to land administration. The expanded mandate of the Revenue Department, noted above, has resulted in a growing gap between demand for public services and the Department's ability to meet the demand in a timely manner. This has had the effect of increasing the costs for routine transactions such as copies of Records of Rights which is equivalent to a land title in India and to discretionary and sometimes corrupt behavior on the part of local revenue officials.[^48] The Bank's report recommends that in addition to promoting the adoption of modern digitized technological tools for use by the Revenue Department that expanding the number of trained surveyors is necessary for the Survey and Settlement Department. Based on pilot projects, it appears that this objective can be accomplished at little cost through technical training of village youth with the collaboration of self-help groups.

The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) is the responsible authority for all development projects involving displacement of 500 or more families in plain areas or 250 or more families in hilly areas. MRD is responsible, through the offices of the R&R Commissioner and Administrator for R&R Planning and Implementation for implementing the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affect Families, issued in 2004. In addition, there are state agencies responsible for the implementation of state laws and policies on R&R, specifically for the States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. With respect to land acquisition, which is required in the case of sub-stations, though not transmission lines (TLs), the sector agency is obliged to apply for authorization to the state District Collector under the Terms of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and the DC plays a significant role in allocating and disbursing compensation to project affected families.

55. With respect to projects affecting Indigenous Peoples, per the requirements of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of the Rights) Act of 2006 the responsible governmental authority resides at the State level in State Level Monitoring Committees and at the District and Sub-divisional level Committees to be established under the Act under the ultimate authority of the central Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The committees are to include representatives of the Departments of Revenue, Forest and Tribal Affairs of the State governments. In addition, where applicable, the Ministry of Panchayats, the authority for implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) have authority for specified impacts of projects on Indigenous Peoples to the extent that PESA is applicable.

42. In addition to issuing FCs, the Forest Conservation Division is responsible for implementing the Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) under the authority of the National Afforestation and Eco-Development Board.[^40] To date, 715 Forest Development Areas (FDAs) have been operationalized focusing on the rehabilitation of areas affected by shifting cultivation. In the year ending October 3 1, 2006, Rs. 109.46 crores was released to FDAs for implementation of the National Afforestation Program.[^41] Under applicable provisions of this program POWERGRID is obliged deposit an assessed compensatory Afforestation payment based on the Net Present Value of diverted land with the Department of Forest as a condition for obtaining FC.


43. For proposed TLs passing through forest areas POWERGRID regional HQ and site offices consult State Forest Departments to confirm the legal status, baseline condition and ecological importance and sensitivity of the affected forest lands. Therefore, it is important that State and regional Forest Departments have accurate Geographic Information System (GIs) data on forest conditions. Recent independent studies indicate that such data is routinely collected at the District but is not fully geared to address the information needs of integrated development planning. The desired information about the potential, capability and effectiveness of GIs technology in the analysis, mapping and management of natural resources is not readily available to the user agencies mainly owing to lack of coordination among the government departments at various levels which is not yet considered user friendly. These obstacles could be removed only interlinking school and college education with the requirements of development planning of the country and evolving low cost and more user friendly GIS technology.[^42]

47. Support for an "ecodevelopment" approach to the conservation of protected areas emerged in India in the 1990's as a response to the failures of the traditional "protection/exclusion" system of wildlife management, with the aim of accommodating the welfare and behavior of local people and integrating these concerns into the management of PAS. Under the auspices of the National Wildlife Action Plan (1983), the Environmental Action Plan (1993) and the GoI's support for the 1993 Convention on Biodiversity, the GoI increasingly broadened efforts to enhance community participation. The Eighth Five-year Plan (1992-97) incorporated the ecodevelopment approach and it has since become central to promoting wildlife management throughout India. World Bank support of the Ecodevelopment Project approved in 1996 and implemented through 2002 was accompanied by a marked improvement in the capacity of central and state PA management authorities.[^45]

48. Despite the internationally recognized capacity of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) established in 1982, which trains wildlife managers from throughout the South Asia region, the majority of PPAs in the country are managed by personnel lacking basic training in wildlife management. As part of the Tenth Five Year Plan a number of initiatives are underway to strengthen the capacity of the Wildlife Division. These include ten ongoing research projects dealing with applied wildlife conservation undertaken primarily by academic and civil society organization^.[^46]
