### Government Regulation (PP) No. 06 of 2007 re: Forest Management and Forest Management Planning, and Forest Utilization

SUMMARY

The law aims at securing sustainable forestry management for the improvement of people’s welfare, specifying what organizations will carry out forestry utilization and management, and the planning thereof. The exploitation of conservation forests, protected forests and production forests must be preceded by forest management plans, both in the short and long terms, and the law provides for the issuance of licenses for these forest types, as well as the obligations of the licensees. It also specifies the sanctions to be imposed upon permit-holders that violate specific provisions of the law.

CONSULTATION

The law contains a large number of requirements for public consultation, both direct and indirect. Most of them have to do with the manner in which forestry management is carried out, requirements to be fulfilled for the granting licenses, as well as sanctions for violation of the requirement. Article 26 is of great significance for public consultation, as it prohibits the collection of non-timber forest products in protected forests by anyone other than the local community.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Forest Management Totality (KPH) is a forest management area, in accordance with the basic function and designation, which can be managed in an efficient and sustainable manner.
Forest Arrangement is an activity geared at designing a forest management unit, which covers activities of forest resource classification in accordance with the types of ecosystems and potentials contained therein. These activities have the goal of obtaining the maximal benefit for the people, in a sustainable manner.
Forest Exploitation is an activity of utilizing the forest area, including environmental services, timber and non-timber forest products, optimally and fairly in a sustainable manner for the benefit of the people’s welfare.
Area Exploitation is an activity of utilizing growth space to obtain optimal environmental, social and economic benefits, without impairing the main function.
License to Exploit Forest is a license issued by the authorized official, comprising the following licenses:
Business License to Utilize Area (IUPK), granted to utilize areas in protected and/or production forests.
Business License to Utilize Environmental Service (IUPJL), granted to utilize environmental services in protected and/or production forests.
Business License to Utilize Timber Forest Products (IUPHHK) and/or Business License to Utilize Non-Timber Forest Products (IUPHHBK), granted to utilize forest products in the form of timber and/or non-timber inside natural forests in production forests, through harvesting/felling, enrichment, preservation and marketing.
IUPHHK of Ecosystem Restoration Inside Natural Forest, granted for the preservation of the function and representation of production forests with important ecosystems.
IUPHHK/IUPHHBK inside timber estate, issued to utilize timber/non-timber forest products in production forest.
License to Collect Timber Forest Products (IPHHK), issued to take timber forest products in production forests.
License to Collect Non-Timber Forest Products (IPHHK), issued to take non-timber forest products in protected and/or production forests.
Industrial Timber Estate (HTI) is a timber estate in production forest, made up of groups of forest industry.
Smallholder Timber Estate (HTR) is a timber estate in production forest, made up of groups of communities.
Concession Forest is a forest located on land charged with a land title.
Communal Forest is a state forest, the main utilization of which is directed to empower communities.
Rural Forest is a forest that has not yet been charged with a license or right, which is managed by a village and utilized for the welfare of that village.

Article 11 stipulates that the forest arrangement for every KPH is executed in the whole forest area concerned. The government can also stipulate certain locations inside the forest as communal, traditional or rural forest, or forest area with special purpose (KGHDTK). Areas thus specified are inseparable from sustainable forest management principles.

Article 13 stipulates that the forest management plans formulated by the heads of KPH will pay due attention to the aspirations and cultural values of the local communities. Long-term forest management plans must contain strategies aimed at optimizing the functions of forest resources through activities such as community empowerment. Short-term forest management plans must contain a description of the participation of parties, which includes representatives of communities benefitting and/or impacted by the management of KPH.

Article 17, 18 and 19 state that forest exploitation is to be aimed at obtaining optimal benefits of forest products and services in a sustainable manner for the welfare of the people. This applies to conservation forests (excluding wildlife reserves, jungle zones and core zones in national parks), protected forests and production forests, and all such exploitation requires the appropriate license.

Article 23 states that forest exploitation in protected forests can be executed through the utilization of areas or environmental services, of through the collection of non-timber forest products (except inside “protecting blocks”). All these activities are to be aimed at enhancing the welfare of the communities, particularly local communities, through the improvement of communal awareness in preserving and enhancing the functions of protected forests.

Article 24 states that utilizations as meant in Article 23 may not result in negative impacts on the socio-economic condition of the community.

Article 26 requires that only communities around the forests execute the collection of non-timber forest products in protected forests. This collection is also executed only on condition that they have been available naturally, that the activity does not damage the environment, and that the main function is not reduced, changed or eliminated as a result of the activity. The collection may not be in quantities exceeding sustainable productivity or be of products protected by the law.

Article 32 states that the utilization of areas in production forests may not bring any negative impact to the socio-economic condition of the community.

Article 45 grants the collection of timber forest products inside natural forest in production forests to meet the need for building public facilities for local community groups and to grant the needs of Indonesians, so long as the collected timber product is not traded and does not exceed 50 and 20 cubic meters, respectively. These quotas are adjusted according to the need for public facilities and housing.

Article 46 states that the collection of non-timber forest products inside natural forest in production forests is aimed at fulfilling the needs of local communities, and the products may be traded.

Article 47 states that the collection of non-timber forest products inside timber estates in production forests is aimed at fulfilling the needs of local communities, and the products may be traded.

Article 50 states that the validity period of the IUPJL in production forests, in the case of the utilization of water current service, is limited to 25 years, with the maximum value of 20 percent of the available debit of surface water, provided this does not reduce the public’s right to access the water.

Article 71 [letter a] requires all holders of business licenses to exploit forest areas to formulate action plans for the whole working area, in accordance with the validity period of the license and on the basis of the forest management plan prepared by the KPH. This action plan will contain, among other things, a description of the socio-economic condition of communities in the forest areas.

Article 72 requires holders of IUPJL, IUPHHK and IUPHHBK to cooperate with local community cooperatives, no later than one year after receiving the license. This cooperation can be in the form of participating interest or business cooperation in the segment of forest product exploitation.

Article 73 requires holders of IUPHHK to formulate long-term business plans for the exploitation of timber forest products (RKUPHHK) [paragraph 1 letter a] as well as an annual action plan (RKT) [paragraph 1 letter b] no later than one year after the license has been issued. While not explicitly stated, it is likely that these plans are to include the socio-economic condition of the community as meant in Article 71. This requirement also applied to holders of IUPHHK of ecosystem restoration inside natural forests in production forests. [paragraph 5 letters a-c]

Article 75 applies the same requirements as Article 73 on holders of IUPHHK in HTI inside timber estates [paragraph 1 letters a-b]. Furthermore, these licensees are obliged to provide a maximum of 5 percent of the total area as live planting space for partnership with local communities. [paragraph 1 letter i]

Article 76 requires holders of IUPHHBK to formulate long-term business plans for the exploitation of non-timber forest products (RKUPHHBK) [letter a] as well as an annual action plan (RKT) [letter b] no later than one year after the license has been issued.

Articles 79 and 80 stipulate that part of the forest-exploitation contribution and fund shall be composed of Provision of Forest Resources (PSDH), imposed on holders of the licenses IUPK, IUPJL, IUPHHK and/or IUPHHBK inside natural forest and/or timber estate, or IPHHK and/or IPHHBK, as well as a Reforestation Fund (DR) imposed on holders of IUPHHK inside natural forests. However, the collection of PSDH and DR does not apply to forest products from traditional forests that are utilized by traditional communities and not traded; timber forest products directly used by local communities and not traded; or timber forest products from concession or communal forests.

Articles 83 and 84 require the empowerment of the local community through the development of its capacity and provision of access in enhancing its welfare. This requirement is the obligation of the government, provincial governments and regional/municipal governments, and the implementation thereof is the responsibility of the heads of KPH. The local community empowerment can be realized through rural forest, social forest or partnership.

Articles 87 and 88 stipulate that local community empowerment through rural forest will be executed by granting exploitation rights to rural institutions in protected and production forests. The government, provincial governments or regional/municipal governments must also, according to their scope, facilitate institutional and business development as well as education, training and access to the market.

Articles 92 to 97 stipulate that local community empowerment through social forest, in conservation, protected or production forests, is executed through the issuance of a business license, in the form of IUPHHK to groups of communities in the form of cooperatives, to exploit social forests. The Minister, based on requests from local communities and recommendations from regents/mayors, stipulates the working area, and the government, provincial governments or regional/municipal governments must also, according to their scope, facilitate institutional and business development as well as education, training and access to the market. Such a license cannot be transferred or be used as collateral.

Article 99 stipulates that community empowerment through partnerships is possible where the forest area has been provided either with a license for forest exploitation or a forest exploitation right for state-owned enterprises in the forestry sector. Partnership is defined as the cooperation between local communities and forest exploitation licensees on the basis of an agreement, and the minister, governors or regents/mayors are obligated to facilitate the establishment of such partnerships, including helping to settle conflicts. This partnership does not change the authority of the license or rights holders to exploit forests.

Article 104 states the creation of employment opportunities as one of the goals of forest-product primary industry, defined as downstream forest-product industries as meant in Law No. 41/1999 on Forestry, including both timber and non-timber industries.

Article 107 states that industrial business licenses and licenses to expand timber and non-timber forest product primary industry can only be granted to Indonesian individuals, cooperatives, private companies (BUMS Indonesia), state-owned companies (BUMN) and regional administration-owned companies (BUMD). Indonesian individuals and cooperatives are furthermore the only entities eligible for business licenses in the timber sewing industry (with a production capacity of up to 2,000 cubic meters per year) as well as industrial registry number for non-timber forest-product primary industry of timber estate. Any non-Indonesian business venture into this industry could thus require consultation with entities permitted to hold such licenses.

Article 109 states that holders of business license for timber forest product primary industry can cooperate with holders of concession forests to meet their needs to raw material. This means that industrial license holders can collect timber from land or plantations belonging to communities.

Article 129 states that administrative sanction in the form of suspension of administrative service will be imposed upon holders of IUPHHK in HTI or HTR inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 75 paragraph 1 letters a or i.

Article 130 states that administrative sanction in the form of suspension of activity in the field will be imposed on holders of IUPK or IUPJL or forest and on holders of IUPHHK inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provision of Article 71 letter a.

Article 131 defines the administrative sanctions of Articles 129 and 130 as being imposed for one year. The sanction can be revoked at any time if the licensee fulfills the obligations within that year, and if the licensee fails to do so within the year, the license will be revoked after receiving three written warnings, in a period of 30 days for each warning.

Article 132 states that the administrative sanction in the form of a fine up to 10 times the basic price of wood will be imposed on holders of IUPHHK in HTI or HTR inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provision of Article 75 paragraph 1 letter c.

Article 133 states that the administrative sanction in the form of revocation of license will be imposed on:
holders of IUPHHK inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 73 paragraph 1 letter a or b;
holders of IUPHHK of ecosystem restoration inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 73 paragraph 5 letters a or b;
holders of IUPHHK in HTI inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 75 paragraph 1 letter a or b; and
holders of IUPHHBK if they violate the provision of Article 76 letter a or b.  

Article 134 states that the license holders identified above will be given three written warnings in a period of 30 days for each warning before their licenses are revoked, in order to allow them to meet their obligations.
