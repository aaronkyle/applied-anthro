### Government Regulation (PP) No. 27 of 1999 re: Environmental Impact Assessment

SUMMARY

The law aims at preserving the main functions of the environment in utilizing natural resources to improve the welfare of the people. This is done through requirements associated with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required of every business and/or activity plan likely to have significant environmental impacts. It defines the conservation of the environment as being the interest of the entire community, which in turn necessitates the participation of the community in the process of analyzing impacts likely to affect it. This law concerns the requirements associated with who is required to perform an EIA and in what manner, and not the content of said EIA.

CONSULTATION

The requirements for public consultation all emerge from the stated principle of public participation in the analysis of environmental impacts. Hence, the law’s requirements for public consultation concern the definition of this participation and the form in which it will be carried out.

Article 3 states that what is defined as a major and significant impact on the environment includes activities that could affect artificial, social and cultural environments. Pending a decision of the Minister, these activities could be required to perform an EIA.

Article 5 lists the following criteria for a particular business and/or activity plan’s major and significant impacts:

The number of human beings that will be exposed to the impacts.
The extent of the area affected.
The intensity and duration of the impacts from the time of occurrence.
The number of other environmental components affected by the impacts.
The cumulative nature of the impacts.
The reversibility/irreversibility of the impacts.

Accurately determining these criteria will require some level of public consultation. The article also states that the criteria may be adapted in accordance with scientific and technological developments.

Articles 9 and 10 include representatives of the affected communities as necessary parts of the central and regional commissions of assessment of the EIA. On the regional level, the representatives of the community are expected to be able to provide inputs about the aspirations of the affected communities.

Articles 19 to 21 stipulates that the central or regional commission of assessment will assess the EIA and plans for environmental management and monitoring, after which the responsible government agency will issue a decision on the environmental worthiness of the proposed business/activity. This decision is required to take the suggestions, opinions and responses of community members into account. The decision will be issued no later that 75 working days after the receipt of the documents, failing which the worthiness will be assumed by default. In those 75 days, consultation with community members on the received plans will take place. Should the documents be deemed incomplete, the responsible government agency will return analyses and documents with plans for improvement to the initiator. [Cf. Article 34]

Article 31 stipulates that EIA for businesses/activities undertaken by the economically weak will be assisted by the government, for example in the form of funding to cover the associated costs. This could entail public consultation if a business partner in the form of an economically weak community or cooperative is required to perform an EIA.

Article 33 states that community members are to be allowed to submit their suggestions, opinions and responses regarding the implementation of the business/activity within three days of the public announcement of the business and/or activity plan. These will be submitted in writing to the responsible government agency, and all suggestions and opinions must be reflected in the framework of reference and studied in the analysis of environmental impacts.

Article 34 requires the participation and involvement of concerned community members in the process of drawing up and evaluating the framework of reference, of the analysis of environmental impacts, and of the plans for environmental management and monitoring. The head of a government agency assigned to control environmental impacts will stipulate the form and procedure of this involvement.

Article 37 stipulates that the costs associated with the drawing up and assessment of the framework of reference, the EIA and the plan for environmental monitoring will be borne by the initiating party. As these activities require the participation of the community, this implies that any costs associated with this consultation will be borne by the initiator.


DISCLOSURE

While the law contains only two requirements for public disclosure that are intimately connected to the requirements for public consultation, they are quite important for compliance with the law. The principle of both, as well as of the law as a whole, is that the public shall be informed of any and all impacts that might affect it.

Article 33 requires all businesses/activities to be announced to the community before the EIA is conducted. The announcement will be made by the responsible government agency in the form of, for example, print and/or electronic media, and by the initiator in the form of, for example, a notice board at the place of operations. The announcement will at least contain the expected results of the business/activity, the types and volumes of waste expected and the method by which it will be managed, and the likely environmental impacts.

Article 35 requires all documents of environmental impact analysis, community suggestions, opinions and responses, conclusions from the commissions of assessment, and the decisions of environmental worthiness of the proposed business and/or activities to be transparent and available to the public. These documents must also be handed over by the responsible government agencies to a documentation and/or archive institution.
