## Caveats and Disclaimers

My work here is on-going.  Attempting to define a organizational framework for the complex, ever-expanding universe of social policy requires considerable time and effort. I contribute to this repository in the hours when I am not [otherwise engaged](http://aaron-kyle.com). I consider no page to be complete. To the contrary, most discussions are in early drafting phases&mdash;not well cross-linked on the site front end and riddled with typos. This will be a life-long project for me.

As I work on defining [terms](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html), I do so with respect to their usage relative to the practice of social development&mdash;I don't worry to much about how a term is used in other disciplines.

I should also emphasise how much I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy'.
