## Steps for Developing a Migration Management Plan

### Objectives

The overarching goal is to successfully define and implement measures to manage in-migration and to avoid, prevent, and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse impacts associated with project-induced in-migration. Specific goals include:

* Limiting the rate of population influx / minimising in-migration of speculative job seekers
* Avoiding and/or mitigating adverse effects of project-induced in-migration on local populations (especially vulnerable groups)
* Addressing adverse social dynamics brought about by in-migration

### Overview

Development of management approach for project-induced in-migration can occur in two phases:

1. strategy design
2. implementation plan in cooperation with government stakeholders and civil society partners.

#### 1) Contextual & Baseline Data

Preparation of the migration management strategy document relies on two principle data streams:</p>

* Situation Analysis: This analysis is the basis for understanding the likely pattern of development of the in-migration phenomenon and identifying its most significant potential environmental and social impacts, the timeframe in which the impact will develop and become tangible, and the likely effect of the impact on the Project. The situation analysis will inform management options and should lead to the development of a migration management strategy lone

* Analysis of Project-Induced Influx on Comparable Projects: This is a review of other large-scale projects which have been developed in similar settings , including a description and analysis of the influx experienced by these projects. Strategy development will require social development team members to make multiple on-site consultation visits to gather key inputs and to prioritise strategy components in dialogue with Project management and staff.

#### 2) Migration Management Plan (MMP)

The Migration Management Plan details comprehensive and long-term approach to migration management. The results of the strategy document  will be refined, verified and detailed in close coordination with government and other local stakeholders and Project contractors.

Continued multi-partite consultations are essential for plan design as well as for revisions to this design during the process of implementation. Component and sub-component design for this plan will likely require a substantial investment in consulting hours and on-going on-site support.

The following list is provided as a general indication of the types of issues the MMP will need to address. This list should not be considered either final or exhaustive.

1. Predicting In-Migration
    - Labour and Workforce Management
    - Site Access Routes

1. Village-level spatial planning
    - Housing
    - Infrastructure and Utilities
    - Buffer zones
    - Food Security
    - Targeted Health Programming

1. Community development
    - Community Health Management
    - Development of Services
    - Development of Markets
    - Strengthening of Cultural Institutions

### Success indicators

Indicators of Success in Migrant Management Planning and Design:

* Clearly articulated roles, responsibilities and expectations of all parties.
    - To avoid feelings of disappointment from arising between, all stakeholder parties need to have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities relative to the MMP and must endeavour to ensure that they are meet expectations and commitments. Establishing clear articulated roles and responsibilities for each party and reasonable expectation and commitments is one measure for successful planning outcomes.

* Spirit of a partnership and cultural respect.
    - Cultivating a spirit of partnership between the stakeholder parties a key ingredient of success. All parties need to hold an equal position when collaborating for migration/influx-management objectives—even in spite of differences in capacity and representation. To achieve this, all parties need to understand the other’s culture for making joint-decisions and must have an underlying respect for each other.

* Clear benefits to all parties.
    - Understanding, from the outset, the benefits of collaboration to all parties is a key to successful partnerships. The NGO must understand and welcome the marketing benefit for the company. In this sense, the parties should agree to a framework for promotion. The company also needs to understand and embrace the social benefits.


Indicators of Successful Migration Management Plan Implementation:

* limiting the rate of population influx / minimizing in-migration of speculative job seekers
    - An in-migration rate not exceeding a 1:3 ratio for project-related to speculative in-migration

* avoiding and/or mitigating adverse effects of project-induced in-migration on local populations (especially vulnerable groups)
    - Stable or reduced instances of diseases and other health problems

* addressing adverse social dynamics brought about by in-migration
    - Promulgation of spatial planning policies and measured compliance
    - Stable or reduced instances of inter-community conflict and effective power-sharing and joint community planning at the kecamatan level

While specific interventions for migration/influx management are certain to be implemented at the village-level, their design may be more effectively conceptualised by planning at the kecamatan level. Specific focus should be paid to managing the effects of in-migration for the villages nearest to planned project construction sites. The plan may, however, call for actions to be taken in towns further afield and at the regency and provincial levels.
