## Meaningful Engagement through Public Consultation, Participation, and Disclosure

Achieving effective stakeholder engagement means building and maintaining constructive relationships over time. Companies seeking international financing must commit to an ongoing consultation engagement process that extends throughout the life of the project. Consultation and engagemetn efforts encompasses a broad range of activities and approaches—from information sharing and consultation to negotiation, participatory decision-making, and partnerships—to ensure that a project and its operators maintain their social license to operate.

A Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) sets forth the a proejct's strategy and program for ensuring effective and culturally-appropriate stakeholder engagement—especially as concerns project-affected communities. [^1] A PCDP defines company commitments for the provision of relevant and understandable information. It also establishes a framework to enable stakeholders to express their needs, concerns, views and interests about project activities in a manner that will allow project operators to respond appropriately to them.

Key aspects of a public consultation and disclosure are as follows:

* Regularly providing meaningful information in a format and language that is readily understandable and tailored to the needs of target stakeholders
* Providing information in advance of consultation activities and decision-making in locations that make it easy for stakeholders to access it
* Displaying respect for local traditions, languages, timeframes, and decision-making processes
* Sustaining a dialogue that gives both sides the opportunity to exchange views and information and to have their issues, concerns and grievances heard and addressed in a timely manner
* Seeking a broad representation of views—including those of women, vulnerable and minority groups
* Establishing processes free of intimidation or coercion
* Encouraging an open-door policy for all stakeholders to feel welcome to directly discuss all issues and express concerns
* Incorporating feedback into project and program design, and reporting back to stakeholders

The PCDP should also be seen as part of a larger project effort to consult with and engage the local communities, such as project social development programmes and community development plan. Whereas the PCDP seeks greater consultation, transparent sharing of information and good relations with local project-affect communities, these other approaches focus more on benefits-sharing arrangements and stakeholder participation in decision-making.
