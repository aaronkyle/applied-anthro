### Social Policy

The corpus of social and environmental 'policy' at the World Bank is comprised of 'stand-alone' [operational policy instruments](# "for more information on the Bank's operational policies, refer to the*The World Bank Operational Manual*"). <sup>[c.f. [IFC](/context/social-policy_adb.html), [EBRD](#/context/social-policy_ebrd.html) and [ADB](/context/social-policy_adb.html)]</sup> ['Social development policies' at the World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialdevelopment/brief/social-development-policies) aim to minimize the negative impact of Bank-funded operations. Policy is thematically distinguished, i.e. ['Indigenous Peoples'](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTOPMANUAL/0,,contentMDK:20553653~pagePK:64141683~piPK:64141620~theSitePK:502184,00.html "Indigenous Peoples - OP 4.10"), ['Involuntary Resettlement'])("Involuntary Resettlement - OP 4.12."), ['Conflict and Development'](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTOPMANUAL/0,,contentMDK:20129203~pagePK:64141683~piPK:64141620~theSitePK:502184,00.html "Development Cooperation and Conflict - OP 2.30"), and ['Gender and Development'](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTOPMANUAL/0,,contentMDK:20064559~pagePK:64141683~piPK:64141620~theSitePK:502184,00.html "Gender and Development - OP 4.20").<sup>[1](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialdevelopment/brief/social-development-policies)</sup>



#### Toward Defining a 'Safeguard Policy Framework' at the World Bank


The concept of 'safeguards policy' is [tauted on the World Bank website as a cornerstone of World Bank sustainable poverty reduction](http://go.worldbank.org/WTA1ODE7T0), but the Bank does not explicitly distinguish stand-alone safeguard policies. Rather, the concept of safeguard is manifest in policy statements that that certain issues require special attention during project design and implementation and therefore requires certain types of interventions as part of loan processing.That is to say, safeguards are [considered to be written into each of several thematically-defined policies](http://go.worldbank.org/XFBVTIUDK0)&mdash;principally within the *Operational Manual*.[2](# "The [Access to Information](http://go.worldbank.org/TRCDVYJ440) policy might also be considered a type of safeguard.")

#### [Safeguards Policy](http://go.worldbank.org/WTA1ODE7T0)

The World Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies are a cornerstone of its support to sustainable poverty reduction. The objective of these policies is to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. These policies provide guidelines for bank and borrower staffs in the identification, preparation and implementation of programs and projects.

The effectiveness and development impact of projects and programs supported by the Bank has substantially increased as a result of attention to these policies.Safeguard policies have often provided a platform for the participation of stakeholders in project design, and have been an important instrument for building ownership among local populations.

**Safeguards at Work**

For example, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project involved urban resettlement on an unparalleled scale, thus requiring compliance with the World Bank’s resettlement safeguard policy, among others.Over 100,000 people living along roads and railway tracks were to be resettled to improve rail and road transport services.Almost 95% of the affected people did not have legal title to the land they occupied. Affected structures included an assortment of residences, businesses, religious and community facilities, schools, dispensaries and nurseries.

The unprecedented scale and complexity of the process called for innovative solutions.Recognizing people's concerns regarding involuntary resettlement, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) altered its approach from one that narrowly focused on compensating people for their losses towards one that sought to arrive at a ‘win-win' solution for all.This resulted in wider consultation and negotiation with the affected people, with the help of NGOs.

The agency's willingness to adapt and explore alternative solutions, often surpassing the scope of its Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, enabled it to come up with innovative resettlement options that were more agreeable to the affected people. Going beyond the provision of brick and mortar resettlement sites, the MMRDA helped the resettled people to adapt to their new environments. Resettlement colonies were provided with schools, day-care centers, and women's centers. People's livelihood options were expanded through skills training for the youth and micro-credit for women.

An independent study has found that the provision of formal housing to resettled families has raised their social status and improved their employability and creditworthiness. It has also given them, especially the women, a greater sense of security in their new homes.

**Preparing for the Next Generation of Environmental and Social Protection**

The issues our clients face have changed dramatically over the last 20 years, and their ability to manage them – as well as the Bank’s - has significantly increased.In late 2012, the World Bank launched a multi-phased process to review and update its environmental and social safeguard policies.

The multi-stage review, supported by several periods of global consultations with stakeholders, is being undertaken in response to the need to better address environmental and social issues that countries face today, to deliver better environmental and social outcomes in the projects and programs the Bank supports, to ensure treatment and coverage of environmental and social impacts and risks, to strengthen the ability to monitor and supervise actual impacts on people and the environment, and to better meet the varied needs of borrowers, and help strengthen country frameworks and institutions to deliver sustainable results on the ground.

The second phase of the review - consultations on a first draft of the proposed Environmental and Social Framework - closed on March 1, 2015.The excellent stakeholder feedback we received is being compiled and reviewed, and the draft document will then be revised and shared again.

World Bank Performance Standards

On June 26, 2012, the Board of Executive Directors approved adoption and application of World Bank Performance Standards to be used for Bank financing or support (e.g., Partial Risk Guarantees) which is destined to projects, or components thereof, that are owned, constructed, and/or operated by the private sector, in place of the World Bank environmental and social Safeguard Policies (R2012-0130;IDA/R2012-0161).Technical assistance for preparatory work for private sector engagement in PPPs would be eligible, as well as investment operations that include medium -or long-term management contracts, affermage/leases, privatizations, concessions, and projects within the Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) family.Financial Intermediary lending also is a candidate, provided the Bank lending or guarantee to the financial intermediary is designated for subprojects implemented by the private sector or private parties.

### Analysis

[Anthony Hall](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/profile/anthony-hall/) characterizes the social policy at the World Bank as distinguishable by three conceptually and operationally separate agendas: social welfare, social protection and social development. Welfare services and basic human needs, as well as social protection in the form of safety nets and social safeguards, together form the mainstay of what is generally regarded within the organization as constituting social policy. Social development reflects a broader if more fragmented view of social policy. Bank specialists have recently sought to widen the definition of social policy beyond welfare and protection, building upon longstanding academic discourse in this field. However, in attempting to pursue a more holistic and over-arching vision of social policy for development, they are likely to encounter major internal obstacles. Meeting this challenge will not be facilitated by the Bank reorganization announced in June 2006, which may serve to restrict the independence and remit of environmental and social specialists.

The World Bank's New Environmental and Social Policies Fail to Tackle Climate Change
Posted: 08/01/2014 1:30 pm EDT Updated: 10/01/2014 5:59 am EDT


Over the last two years, the Bank has been reviewing its environmental and social safeguard policies. The review process presents an important opportunity for the Bank to adopt best practices for promoting low-carbon and resilient development by establishing strong policy language on climate change. Nonetheless, a draft of proposed new policies does not address climate issues systematically.

Despite the Bank's urgent warnings that a warming world poses great risks to its development objectives, the Draft only mentions climate change sporadically, and fails to clearly articulate what borrowers will have to do to assess the climate impacts of their projects, or how climate change will affect their viability. Only very limited and inadequate climate assessments are envisioned in the new policies. On top of this, the largest loophole of all is that the proposed policies will not apply to nearly half of all Bank lending, since they explicitly exclude policy lending which is set to overtake traditional project finance in the coming years.

On many public occasions, President Kim of the World Bank has called on governments world-wide to give climate change the attention it deserves as the single largest threat to any human development. The draft of Bank's new policies, cleared by the Board of the institution for public consultations, proves that the Bank has failed to walk the talk on climate. According to President Kim of the Bank, this was supposed to be the year for climate action. The climate action his institution is taking, however, will serve as a dangerous precedent to the world by showing how to avoid acting on climate.

The Draft of new Bank policies contains only a generic requirement that the impacts of projects on climate change be assessed, with no details to guide the scope of assessment or the implementation plan. Critically, the Draft does not require that impacts on the resilience of host communities be considered. Through its new proposed policies, the Bank will start accounting for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of some of its projects, but the policies stop short of requiring GHG accounting for all Bank projects and they do not require the quantification, or even the consideration, of environmental and social externalities. Furthermore, the Draft does not specify how the information that is collected on GHG emissions will be used and for what purposes.


While the Bank has recently highlighted the significant quantifiable economic and development benefits of taking even modest action on climate change, it is borderline hypocritical that the Bank's own core operational policies do not match this analysis and messaging. As such, the proposed policies need to be reviewed to properly address the true needs of communities and the planet vis-à-vis climate change. The World Bank's new policies should require the use of transparent planning and assessment tools to ensure that the Bank's activities are as low-cost, low-carbon, pro-poor, and sustainable as possible. They should specifically require borrowers to assess and manage (a) the climate-related risks facing supported projects and their resilience to those risks; (b) the impacts they will have on the climate resilience of local communities and ecosystems; and (c) the effects of the project on efforts to mitigate climate change.

The new policies of the Bank are expected to be ready for a final approval by the Board of the World Bank sometime next year. President Kim has all the time and resources he needs to live up to his promises given to Civil Society Organizations that he would take into account their suggestions for a strong policy on climate.

An institution that sees itself as a vanguard of social and environmental sustainability should strive for the highest standards. The world's poorest, supposedly the "beneficiaries" of World Bank projects, should not have to settle for displacement, violation of human rights, environmental destruction, and exacerbation of climate change in the name of "development." During one of his many public presentations, President Kim said, "In 20 years, all of us will be asked the question, 'What did you do to fight climate change?'. The leaders..., both from the private sector and from governments, have in their power to act in substantive ways. Now is the time to act for future generations before it is too late." Now we ask him what he is going to do today to fight climate change. His time to act is now!
