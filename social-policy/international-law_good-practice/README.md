In addition to the discussions filed here, I also once (2009 or so) compiled a fairly comprehensive [reference list of international laws affecting indigenous peoples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3GNtRESh9awKXkk5S2Jmg4evH76RwtRp6fdvN-GqFw/edit?usp=sharing).  I don't actively maintain it.


### Voluntary International Social Policy ‘Good Practice’ Frameworks

To achieve internationally-recognized “good practice” disclosure frameworks for sustainability reporting, it is important to issue periodic reports on project performance relative to key sustainability indicators, as culled from a variety of recognized international standards.

This folder examines sustanability reporting provisions within the [Equator Principles](), the [UN Global Compact](./un-global-compact.md), [ISO 26000](./iso-26000.md), the [IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting](./ipieca-sustainability-reporting.md), the [Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)](./gri.md) and the [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)](./eiti.md).
