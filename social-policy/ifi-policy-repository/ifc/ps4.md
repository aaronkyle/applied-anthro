|	Introduction

1.	Performance Standard 4 recognizes that project activities, equipment, and infrastructure can increase community exposure to risks and impacts.
1.	In addition, communities that are already subjected to impacts from climate change may also experience an acceleration and/or intensification of impacts due to project activities.
1.	While acknowledging the public authorities’ role in promoting the health, safety, and security of the public, this Performance Standard addresses the client’s responsibility to avoid or minimize the risks and impacts to community health, safety, and security that may arise from project related-activities, with particular attention to vulnerable groups.
2.	In conflict and post-conflict areas, the level of risks and impacts described in this Performance Standard may be greater.
2.	The risks that a project could exacerbate an already sensitive local situation and stress scarce local resources should not be overlooked as it may lead to further conflict.

|	Objectives

*.	* To anticipate and avoid adverse impacts on the health and safety of the Affected Community during the project life from both routine and non-routine circumstances.
*.	* To ensure that the safeguarding of personnel and property is carried out in accordance with relevant human rights principles and in a manner that avoids or minimizes risks to the Affected Communities.

|	Scope of Application

3.	The applicability of this Performance Standard is established during the environmental and social risks and impacts identification process.
3.	The implementation of the actions necessary to meet the requirements of this Performance Standard is managed through the client’s Environmental and Social Management System, the elements of which are outlined in Performance Standard 1.
4.	This Performance Standard addresses potential risks and impacts to the Affected Communities from project activities.
4.	Occupational health and safety requirements for workers are included in Performance Standard 2, and environmental standards to avoid or minimize impacts on human health and the environment due to pollution are included in Performance Standard 3.

|	Requirements

|	Community Health and Safety

5.	The client will evaluate the risks and impacts to the health and safety of the Affected Communities during the project life-cycle and will establish preventive and control measures consistent with good international industry practice (GIIP),[FN1] such as in the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHS Guidelines) or other internationally recognized sources.
5.	[FN1] The term “client” is used throughout the Performance Standards broadly to refer to the party responsible for implementing and operating the project that is being financed, or the recipient of the financing, depending on the project structure and type of financing. The term “project” is defined in Performance Standard 1.
5.	The client will identify risks and impacts and propose mitigation measures that are commensurate with their nature and magnitude.
5.	These measures will favor the avoidance of risks and impacts over minimization.

|	Infrastructure and Equipment Design and Safety

6.	The client will design, construct, operate, and decommission the structural elements or components of the project in accordance with GIIP, taking into consideration safety risks to third parties or Affected Communities.
6.	When new buildings and structures will be accessed by members of the public, the client will consider incremental risks of the public’s potential exposure to operational accidents and/or natural hazards and be consistent with the principles of universal access.
6.	Structural elements will be designed and constructed by competent professionals, and certified or approved by competent authorities or professionals.
6.	When structural elements or components, such as dams, tailings dams, or ash ponds are situated in high-risk locations, and their failure or malfunction may threaten the safety of communities, the client will engage one or more external experts with relevant and recognized experience in similar projects, separate from those responsible for the design and construction, to conduct a review as early as possible in project development and throughout the stages of project design, construction, operation, and decommissioning.
6.	For projects that operate moving equipment on public roads and other forms of infrastructure, the client will seek to avoid the occurrence of incidents and injuries to members of the public associated with the operation of such equipment.

|	Hazardous Materials Management and Safety

7.	The client will avoid or minimize the potential for community exposure to hazardous materials and substances that may be released by the project.
7.	Where there is a potential for the public (including workers and their families) to be exposed to hazards, particularly those that may be life-threatening, the client will exercise special care to avoid or minimize their exposure by modifying, substituting, or eliminating the condition or material causing the potential hazards.
7.	Where hazardous materials are part of existing project infrastructure or components, the client will exercise special care when conducting decommissioning activities in order to avoid exposure to the community.
7.	The client will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to control the safety of deliveries of hazardous materials, and of transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes, and will implement measures to avoid or control community exposure to pesticides, in accordance with the requirements of Performance Standard 3.

|	Ecosystem Services

8.	The project’s direct impacts on priority ecosystem services may result in adverse health and safety risks and impacts to Affected Communities.
8.	With respect to this Performance Standard, ecosystem services are limited to provisioning and regulating services as defined in paragraph 2 of Performance Standard 6.
8.	For example, land use changes or the loss of natural buffer areas such as wetlands, mangroves, and upland forests that mitigate the effects of natural hazards such as flooding, landslides, and fire, may result in increased vulnerability and community safety-related risks and impacts.
8.	The diminution or degradation of natural resources, such as adverse impacts on the quality, quantity, and availability of freshwater, [FN2] may result in health-related risks and impacts.
8.	[FN2] Freshwater is an example of provisioning ecosystem services.
8.	Where appropriate and feasible, the client will identify those risks and potential impacts on priority ecosystem services that may be exacerbated by climate change.
8.	Adverse impacts should be avoided, and if these impacts are unavoidable, the client will implement mitigation measures in accordance with paragraphs 24 and 25 of Performance Standard 6.
8.	With respect to the use of and loss of access to provisioning services, clients will implement mitigation measures in accordance with paragraphs 25–29 of Performance Standard 5.

|	Community Exposure to Disease

9.	The client will avoid or minimize the potential for community exposure to water-borne, water-based, water-related, and vector-borne diseases, and communicable diseases that could result from project activities, taking into consideration differentiated exposure to and higher sensitivity of vulnerable groups.
9.	Where specific diseases are endemic in communities in the project area of influence, the client is encouraged to explore opportunities during the project life-cycle to improve environmental conditions that could help minimize their incidence.

10.	The client will avoid or minimize transmission of communicable diseases that may be associated with the influx of temporary or permanent project labor.

|	Emergency Preparedness and Response

11.	In addition to the emergency preparedness and response requirements described in Performance Standard 1, the client will also assist and collaborate with the Affected Communities, local government agencies, and other relevant parties, in their preparations to respond effectively to emergency situations, especially when their participation and collaboration are necessary to respond to such emergency situations.
11.	If local government agencies have little or no capacity to respond effectively, the client will play an active role in preparing for and responding to emergencies associated with the project.
11.	The client will document its emergency preparedness and response activities, resources, and responsibilities, and will disclose appropriate information to Affected Communities, relevant government agencies, or other relevant parties.

|	Security Personnel

12.	When the client retains direct or contracted workers to provide security to safeguard its personnel and property, it will assess risks posed by its security arrangements to those within and outside the project site.
12.	In making such arrangements, the client will be guided by the principles of proportionality and good international practice [FN3] in relation to hiring, rules of conduct, training, equipping, and monitoring of such workers, and by applicable law.
12.	[FN3] Including practice consistent with the United Nation’s (UN) Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, and UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.
12.	The client will make reasonable inquiries to ensure that those providing security are not implicated in past abuses; will train them adequately in the use of force (and where applicable, firearms), and appropriate conduct toward workers and Affected Communities; and require them to act within the applicable law.
12.	The client will not sanction any use of force except when used for preventive and defensive purposes in proportion to the nature and extent of the threat.
12.	The client will provide a grievance mechanism for Affected Communities to express concerns about the security arrangements and acts of security personnel.

13.	The client will assess and document risks arising from the project’s use of government security personnel deployed to provide security services.
13.	The client will seek to ensure that security personnel will act in a manner consistent with paragraph 12 above, and encourage the relevant public authorities to disclose the security arrangements for the client’s facilities to the public, subject to overriding security concerns.

14.	The client will consider and, where appropriate, investigate all allegations of unlawful or abusive acts of security personnel, take action (or urge appropriate parties to take action) to prevent recurrence, and report unlawful and abusive acts to public authorities.
