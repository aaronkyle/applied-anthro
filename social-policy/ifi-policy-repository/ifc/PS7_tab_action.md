|	2	|	9	|	Requirements > General	|	[proposed actions will be ] contained in a time-bound plan, such as an Indigenous Peoples Plan, or a broader community development plan with separate components for Indigenous Peoples [3]	|		|		|	[3] The determination of the appropriate plan may require the input of competent professionals.

|	4	|	14	|	Circumstances Requiring Free, Prior, and Informed Consent	|	Document efforts to avoid and otherwise minimize impacts on natural resources and natural areas of importance [9] to Indigenous People;	|		|		|	[9] “Natural resources and natural areas of importance” as referred to in this Performance Standard are equivalent to priority ecosystem services as defined in Performance Standard 6.
