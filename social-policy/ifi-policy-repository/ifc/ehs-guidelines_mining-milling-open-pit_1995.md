WORLD BANK ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
MINING AND MILLING - OPEN PIT

TAILINGS DISPOSAL

Tailings must be disposed of in a manner that optimizes protection of human safety and the environment. On-land
tailings impoundment systems must be designed and constructed in accordance with internationally recognized
engineering practices, local seismic conditions, and precipitation conditions. On-land disposal systems should be
designed to isolate acid leachate-generating material from oxidation or percolating water. Marine discharges of
tailings must not have a significant adverse effect on coastal resources. Riverine discharges are not acceptable
unless the project sponsor provides thorough documentation regarding: 1) environmental analysis of alternatives,
and 2) effects on aquatic resources and downstream users of riverine resources.

If the mining operation involves a series of open pit operations, project sponsors must evaluate the feasibility of
using abandoned open pits for tailings disposal.

LIQUID EFFLUENTS

The following are guidelines for effluent discharged to receiving waters from tailings impoundments, mine
drainage, sedimentation basins, sewage systems, and stormwater drainage. They do not apply to direct discharge of
tailings to the marine environment.

pH 6 to 9
BOD5 50 mg/l
Oil and Grease 20 mg/l
Total Suspended Solids 50 mg/l
Temperature - at the edge of Max 5° C above ambient temperature
a designated mixing zone of receiving waters - max 3° C if
 receiving waters >28° C
 
Residual Heavy Metals

The following are recommended target guidelines below which there is expected to be no risk for significant
adverse impact on aquatic biota or human use. In cases where natural background concentrations exceed these
levels, the discharge may contain concentrations up to natural background levels. Concentrations up to 110% of
natural background can be accepted if no significant adverse impact can be demonstrated.

Arsenic 1.0 mg/l
Cadmium 0.1 mg/l
Chromium, Hexavalent 0.05 mg/l
Chromium, Total 1.0 mg/l
Copper 0.3 mg/l
Iron, Total 2 mg/l
Lead 0.6 mg/l
Mercury 0.002 mg/l
Nickel 0.5 mg/l
Zinc 1.0 mg/l
Cyanide

proposed revisions to the World Bank guidelines.

The following are recommended target guidelines for discharges below which there is expected to be no risk for
significant adverse impact on aquatic biota or human use. In no case should the concentration in the receiving
water outside of a designated mixing zone exceed 0.022 mg/l.

Free Cyanide 0.1 mg/l
Total Cyanide 1.0 mg/l
Weak Acid Dissociable 0.5 mg/l

Measures to prevent access by wildlife and livestock are required for all open waters (examples tailings
impoundments and pregnant leach ponds) where WAD cyanide is in excess of 50 mg/l.

AMBIENT AIR

Concentrations of contaminants, measured outside the project property boundary, should not exceed the following
limits:

Particulate Matter (<10 µm)
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 500 µg/m3
Nitrogen Oxides, as NO2
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 200 µg/m3
Sulfur Dioxide
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 500 µg/m3

OTHER GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS

Erosion and Sediment Control Plan

Project sponsors are required to prepare and implement an erosion and sediment control plan. The plan should
include measures appropriate to the situation to intercept, divert, or otherwise reduce the stormwater runoff from
exposed soil surfaces, tailings dams, and waste rock dumps. Project sponsors are encouraged to integrate vegetative
and non-vegetative soil stabilization measures in the erosion control plan. Sediment control structures (e.g.,
detention/retention basins) should be installed to treat surface runoff prior to discharge to surface water bodies. All
erosion control and sediment containment facilities must receive proper maintenance during their design life.

Mine Reclamation Plan

Project sponsors are required to prepare and implement a mine reclamation plan. The plan should include
reclamation of tailings deposits, any open pit areas, sedimentation basins, and abandoned mine, mill, and camp sites.

 The main objectives of the mine reclamation plan are:
 
a) return the land to conditions capable of supporting prior land use or uses that are equal to or better than prior
land use, to the extent practical and feasible
b) eliminate significant adverse effects on adjacent water resources.

Mine reclamation plans should incorporate the following components:

a) conserve, stockpile, and use topsoil for reclamation
b) slopes of more than 30% should be recontoured to minimize erosion and runoff
c) native vegetation should be planted to prevent erosion and encourage self-sustaining development of a
productive ecosystem on the reclaimed land 

d) budget and schedule for pre- and post-abandonment reclamation activities
e) plan views that show areas cleared, mined, refilled, and revegetated during each of the next 5 years and
estimated activities at subsequent 5 year intervals

Sewage Sludge Disposal

Sewage sludge must be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way in compliance with local laws and
regulations. Project sponsors are encouraged to evaluate the environmental and health implications of using sewage
sludge in reclaiming tailings deposits, waste rock dumps, and mined out areas.

Solid Wastes Disposal

Project sponsors are encouraged to recycle or reclaim materials where possible. If recycling or reclaim is not
practical, these wastes must be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way in compliance with local laws and
regulations. Solvents and similar hazardous materials must not be disposed of in a manner likely to result in soil or
groundwater contamination if groundwater is potentially useable for potable water or irrigation purposes. Waste
rock dumps should be designed and engineered so that materials with high potential to generate acid leachate are
isolated from oxidation or percolating water.

WORKPLACE AIR QUALITY

a) Periodic monitoring of workplace air quality should be conducted for air contaminants relevant to employee
tasks and the plant's operations.
b) Ventilation, air contaminant control equipment, protective respiratory equipment and air quality monitoring
equipment should be well maintained.
c) Protective respiratory equipment must be used by employees when the exposure levels for welding fumes,
solvents and other materials present in the workplace exceed local or internationally accepted standards, or the
following threshold limit values (TLVs):

Arsenic 0.5 mg/m3
Carbon Monoxide 29 mg/m3
Copper 1 mg/m3
Free Silica 5.0 mg/m3
Hydrogen Cyanide 11 mg/m3
Hydrogen Sulfide 14 mg/m3
Lead, Dusts & Fumes, as Pb 0.15 mg/m3
Nitrogen Dioxide 6 mg/m3
Particulate (Inert or Nuisance Dusts) 10 mg/m3
Sulfur Dioxide 5 mg/m3

tested for the presence of toxic, flammable and explosive gases or vapors, and for the lack of oxygen.
b) Adequate ventilation must be provided before entry and during occupancy of these spaces.
c) Personnel must use air-supplied respirators when working in confined spaces which may become contaminated
or deficient in oxygen during the period of occupancy.

labeled containers or vessels.
b) Storage and handling of hazardous materials must be in accordance with local regulations, and appropriate to
their hazard characteristics.
