[Structure and Methodology of the Report]

### equivalence assessment

An equivalence assessment is a standard gap analysis to compare a given CSS framework (i.e. project, sector-agency or reglatory regime) with the policy principles on environment, involuntary resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples of a financing institution (e.g. World Bank, ADB).

### acceptability assessment

The acceptability assessment for ADB's pilot CSS project -- POWERGRID, the first approved by ADB Boad (28 February 2017) --  consisted of (i) a desk review of compliance documentation; (ii) interviews with company officials, both at the headquarters and in the field; (iii) interviews of affected persons; (iv) a review ofcorporate and project-level outputs (environmental and social assessments and rehabilitation action plans); and (v) site visits to selected projects in different locations in India.1 To determine acceptability, the assessment examined three criteria: institutional capacity, processes and procedures, and outputs and outcomes. Each criterion was assessed to be strong, moderate, or weak.

*CSS at ADB* 


ADB provides their equivalence and acceptability assessments under Appendix 6 of the Safeguard Policy Statement: Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems to Address Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues. 

ADBâ€™s SPS establishes 32 policy principles referenced in Tables 1, 2, and 3 of the SPS (corresponding to the environment, involuntary resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples safeguards) were disaggregated into discrete elements for a more detailed comparison.  Each comparison yielded a determination of relative equivalence (fully equivalent, partially equivalent, and not equivalent) between CSS provisions and the corresponding key elements in the SPS.
