## Sub-national Government

Sub-national government refers to the divisions of government at the provincial (_propinsi_), regency (_kabupaten_), and sub-district (_kecamatan_) levels. These units of sub-national government possess administrative authority in all matters other than those retained by the central government and the provinces—including health and safety, education and culture, environment, land affairs, agriculture, transportation, investment, public works, industry and trade, cooperatives and labour.

Similar to the national government, sub-national government authorities have varied interests: collection of taxes, enforcement of legislation, and sustainability of natural resources.  Some are also interested in specifical project activities, including the provision and development of infrastructure (roads, schools, health clinics, etc.) and compensation payments.

Projec-backed community development initiatives can help to lessen the financial, developmental training and capacity-building burdens of the national government, and the project’s success may even have positive reputational consequences.
