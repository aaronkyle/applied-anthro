## Institutions of Governance

In 1990, a central environmental protection agency (_Badan Pengendalian Dampak Lingkungan_, BAPEDAL) separate from the State Ministry of Environment was established, supported by three regional offices with a mandate to improve the enforcement of environmental impact assessment (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan, AMDAL) and pollution control. The review and approval of AMDAL documents at this time were handled either by national level sector commissions (Komisi Pusat) or provincial commissions (Komisi Daerah), according to project scale and source of funding.

With the promulgation of the [Act 23 of 1997 regarding Environmental Management](http://www.vertic.org/media/National%20Legislation/Indonesia/ID_Law_Environmental_Management.pdf) (_[Undang-Undang No. 23 Tahun 1997 tentang : Pengelolaan Lingkungan Hidup](http://www.dpr.go.id/dokjdih/document/uu/UU_2007_23.pdf)_), further reforms to AMDAL and additional regulation became necessary. Under Government Regulation 27 of 1999 regarding Environmental Impact Assessment (_Peraturan Pemerintah No. 27 Tahun 1999 Tentang : Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan Hidup_), the sector commissions were dissolved and consolidated into a single central commission, while the provincial commissions were strengthened. More specific and inclusive provisions for public involvement were introduced along with a suite of supporting technical guidelines. However, Government Regulation 27 of 1999 was somewhat ill-timed and failed to sufficiently reflect the broader political changes of the time that led to political and administrative decentralization.<sup>[1]( "World Bank. 2005. Good Practices of Environmental Impact Analysis: Presenting Examples of AMDAL Good Practice Drawn from Five Regions in Indonesia.")</sup>

Under the current legal framework, established by Law 32 of 2009 and Government Regulation 16 of 2015 on Environmental Protection and Management, the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Forestry were merged into the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (_Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan_, MOEF/KLHK). MOEF/KLHK is a central-level ministry of the Government of Indonesia. Its mandate is to to administer all issues pertaining to environment and forestry in Indonesia, to protect and promote a safe and healthy environment, prevent control and abate environmental harm including pollution, ensure conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, and institutionalize environmental assessment process as an integral part of the development planning process. The MOEF mandates also include monitoring the impact of development on the environment, putting in place the necessary controls, regulations and incentives for the private and public sectors to achieve sustainable development through the judicious use of natural resources, coordination of inter-sector programs, the implementation of policies and legislation with regard to the environment.

After its creation, the newly-merged ministry set up their organization and working mechanism under Ministry Regulation (Permen) LHK 18/Men LHK-II of 2015, which divides the organization as their function. AMDAL and other prevention measures are covered under Directorate General of Forest Planning and Environmental System (_Direktorat Jenderal Planologi dan Tata Lingkungan_, PKTL), whose duties are to administer formulation and implementation of policy in consolidating forest area and arrange environmental sustainability. The Sub-directorate of Application for AMDAL, environmental management and monitoring measures (UKL-UPL), and Environmental Permit under the MOEF Directorate of Prevention for Environmental Impact of Business and Activities are responsible for AMDAL system development and implementation in Indonesia. Although implementation authority has been delegated to district and provincial environment agencies as their authority, the Sub-directorate plays a major role in prevention of environmental impacts at national/central level.

**Regulatory Agencies**

The SPCBs are the main implementing agencies for environmental pollution control on the State level in India. As noted by the World Bank's Country Environmental Assessment (CEA) the SPCBs face challenges with respect to the monitoring and enforcement procedures that are applicable to linear projects, such as highways, roads and transmission lines [^35] However, these weaknesses apply primarily to monitoring impacts of projects involving excavation, such as highways, roads and pipelines that have more significant potential impacts on soil and water resources as well as biodiversity, wildlife, cultural heritage and landscape features rather than the more limited impacts of electrical transmission projects.

In addition to issuing FCs, the Forest Conservation Division is responsible for implementing the Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) under the authority of the National Afforestation and Eco-Development Board.[^40] To date, 715 Forest Development Areas (FDAs) have been operationalized focusing on the rehabilitation of areas affected by shifting cultivation. In the year ending October 3 1, 2006, Rs. 109.46 crores was released to FDAs for implementation of the National Afforestation Program.[^41] Under applicable provisions of this program POWERGRID is obliged deposit an assessed compensatory Afforestation payment based on the Net Present Value of diverted land with the Department of Forest as a condition for obtaining FC.

Agencies consult State Forest Departments to confirm the legal status, baseline condition and ecological importance and sensitivity of the affected forest lands. Therefore, it is important that State and regional Forest Departments have accurate Geographic Information System (GIS) data on forest conditions. Recent independent studies indicate that such data is routinely collected at the District but is not fully geared to address the information needs of integrated development planning. The desired information about the potential, capability and effectiveness of GIs technology in the analysis, mapping and management of natural resources is not readily available to the user agencies mainly owing to lack of coordination among the government departments at various levels which is not yet considered user friendly. These obstacles could be removed only interlinking school and college education with the requirements of development planning of the country and evolving low cost and more user friendly GIS technology.[^42]

47. Support for an "ecodevelopment" approach to the conservation of protected areas emerged in India in the 1990's as a response to the failures of the traditional "protection/exclusion" system of wildlife management, with the aim of accommodating the welfare and behavior of local people and integrating these concerns into the management of PAS. Under the auspices of the National Wildlife Action Plan (1983), the Environmental Action Plan (1993) and the GoI's support for the 1993 Convention on Biodiversity, the GoI increasingly broadened efforts to enhance community participation. The Eighth Five-year Plan (1992-97) incorporated the ecodevelopment approach and it has since become central to promoting wildlife management throughout India. World Bank support of the Ecodevelopment Project approved in 1996 and implemented through 2002 was accompanied by a marked improvement in the capacity of central and state PA management authorities.[^45]

48. Despite the internationally recognized capacity of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) established in 1982, which trains wildlife managers from throughout the South Asia region, the majority of PPAs in the country are managed by personnel lacking basic training in wildlife management. As part of the Tenth Five Year Plan a number of initiatives are underway to strengthen the capacity of the Wildlife Division. These include ten ongoing research projects dealing with applied wildlife conservation undertaken primarily by academic and civil society organization^.[^46]

## Environmental Assessment and Management Procedures


Law 32 of 2009 on Environmental Protection and Management authorized the use of the following diverse instruments for environmental assessment and management:

1.	strategic environmental assessment (SEA, KLHS),
1.	spatial plan,
1.	environmental quality standard,
1.	standard criteria of environmental deterioration,
1.	AMDAL,
1.	UKL-UPL,
1.	permitting,
1.	environmental economic instruments,
1.	environment-based laws and regulations,
1.	environment-based budgeting,
1.	environmental risk analysis,
1.	environmental audit, and 
1.	other instruments as required or will be are available in the future.

Recent amendments made through enactment of Government Regulation 27 of 2012 regarding Environmental Permits, was designed to simplify AMDAL procedures, facilitate greater public participation in the AMDAL process, and provide a stronger legal basis for enforcing AMDAL implementation. For example, Articles 33 and 41 of this government regulation integrates two environmental instruments, i.e., environmental impact assessment (in terms of AMDAL and UKL-UPL) and Environmental Permit. Another significant improvement is that this regulation also allows greater public participation in the AMDAL process.
