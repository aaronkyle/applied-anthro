### Decree of the Chairperson of the Environmental Impact Management Agency, KEP 299/11 of 1996 re: Technical Guidelines on Social Aspects Assessment in Preparing Environmental Impact Analyses

SUMMARY

Establishes technical guidelines on the assessment of social aspects in preparing Environmental Impact Analyses (EIA). The guidelines are stipulated in Appendices 1-5 of this law, with specific guidelines for the preparation of 1) Environmental Impact Analyses; 2) Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Analyses (KA-ANDAL); 3) Environmental Impact Analyses (ANDAL); 4) Environmental Management Plan (RKL); and 5) Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL).

CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

Article 1 defines the social aspect of the EIA as an investigation into demographic, economic and cultural components, which are inseparable from the other EIA components.

Appendix 1 B states the purpose of the Technical Guidelines as:

(1) To understand and enable assessments of social aspects in preparing Environmental Impact Analyses.
(2) To understand the relationship between bio-geophysical and social aspects Environmental Impact Analyses.
(3) To assist in making the process of preparing social aspects in the EIA easier.

Appendix 1 C states that the social component consists of (1) Demography; (2) Economy; and (3) Cultural aspects. The assessment of these will be performed in the preparation of the Terms of Reference of the EIA, the Environmental Management Plan and the Environmental Monitoring Plan.

Appendix 2.1 states that the process of identifying potential social impacts in the components Demography, Economy and Culture may employ methods such as (a) a test list; (b) a simple interaction matrix; (c) field observations; (d) content analyses; and (e) group interaction. This identification should preferably be supported by analogous methods.

Appendix 2.2.1 states that the evaluation of potential impacts to social aspects to select and define components thereof relevant to be studied may include determining whether the planned effort/activity will cause any basic changes to (a) the population structure and process; (b) the pattern of ownership and natural resource control of inhabitants and households; and (c) the norms and value patterns, social institutions, social cohesion, economic activities and natural resources property rights of inhabitants.

Appendix 2.2.2 states that the selection of significant impacts to focus on should take into account (1) the impact on an environmental component that will undergo significant changes and vice versa; (2) social aspect impacts that will likely cause significant impacts on physical chemistry/biological aspects and vice versa; and (3) the causal relation between the significant social aspect impacts themselves.

Appendix 2.3.1 states that in defining project borders, the party must identify any public communities with social structures or socio-cultural values that could potentially be changed as a result of pre-constructional activities, construction and operation of planned efforts/activities. The party must also identify any pre-historical remnants or other items of religious importance for local inhabitants. Social structures are defined as:

(1) local public economic structures (agriculture, plantation, fisheries, services etc.);
(2) companionship structure;
(3) control of natural resources structure in the formal sense as well as according to local indigenous rights (hak ulayat); and
(4) social interactions which develop between the local public.

Appendix 2.3.2 requires the identification of what social structures (defined in Appendix 2.3.1) and sociocultural values may be impacted or changed due to the destruction of natural resources and environmental pollution caused by the planned efforts/activities through water, air and soil. This will be done after defining the ecological borders.

Appendix 2.3.3 states that the definition of social borders must take into account the public community identification results inside the project and ecological borders, as well as identification results outside these borders of communities potentially affected by the effort/activities.

Appendix 3 states that the preparation of the social aspect of the Environmental Impact Analyses must include descriptions of:

a) the social data collection and method of analysis, as well as the impact forecasting and evaluation method;
b) planned efforts or activities;
c) the environmental state;
d) significant impact forecasts; and
e) evaluation of significant impacts.

In preparing these descriptions, a certain level of public consultation will likely be necessary.

Appendix 3.A requires the consideration of the following issues in the description of data collection and analyses method as well as forecasting and impact evaluation method:
a) The scope of the study area will be as stipulated in the Terms of Reference (KA).
b) The examined Environmental Component is derived from the main social aspect issue defined in the KA.
c) The studied social environment component should be of specific locational nature, meaning that all social aspects components defined in the law KEPMENLH Number 14 of 1994 do not necessarily have to be studied.
d) In view of c, social aspect components may be added to the KA of the EIA, provided that a relationship exists between its physical-chemistry, biological and social aspects.

Appendix 3.A.1.1 states that as significant social impacts of a planned activity will not generally be spread evenly across societal groups and levels, the choice of a relevant data collection and evaluation method (both quantitative and qualitative) must take into account:

a) basic or significant social change experienced by a public group or social level to be studied;
b) units of analysis (household, village/desa, district/kabupaten, province) to be measured;
c) other measures deemed significant to the public surrounding location of the planned activity; and
d) availability of work form, time and budget. [Original meaning uncertain, but it seems that availability of these components to the concerned public is intended.]

Appendix 3.A.1.2 lists as possible data collection methods (a) field observation/surveillance; (b) secondary data collection; (c) interviews using questionnaires; (d) in-depth interviews with public figures or people with understanding of the local societyâ€™s condition; and (e) focus-group discussions performed with small homogenous groups (5-7 persons) to collect their opinions, views and aspirations.

Appendix 3.B requires the description of planned efforts/activities to contain data and information on (1) Policy and method of land procurements; (2) Intake of workforce, particularly from the local public; and (3) A development plan for public and social facilities.  

Appendix 3.C states that the environmental status should represent the condition of the social environment of the study area, particularly the social aspects identified in the Terms of Reference as being significantly impacted by the planned efforts/activities. The presented data on social aspects should be limited to relevant issues and closely related to the estimation and evaluation of impacts.

Appendix 3.D requires a systematic description of each environmental component that is expected to experience a significant impact, as follows:
a) Explaining the cause of the impact, such as impacts on the earnings of the public around the planned effort/activity as a follow-up impact of the change in work and working opportunities, or public perceptions towards the effort/activity.
b) Describe the estimation of impact magnitude by analyzing the difference in environmental quality with and without planned activities, and discuss whether the change caused by the impact is in a positive or negative manner.
c) Describe significant characteristics of the magnitude of social impact from the point of view of the public, the government or relevant experts.
d) Describe sub-components or parameters that are affected by further impacts arising from the identified significant social impacts.

Appendix 3.E requires the systematic evaluation of significant impacts, which will include a holistic discussion or study of the significant environmental implications (physic-chemistry, biological and social) as well as significant impact evaluations for each identified alternative for location or technology. The impact evaluation will also consider monetary values to establish a picture of the external costs and/or financial gains for the society or developing party.

Appendix 4 states that in formulating the Environmental Management Plan (RKL) for social aspects in the Environmental Impact Analyses (AMDAL) the following issues must be considered:
1) All the efforts undertaken to prevent, control and overcome any arising significant social impacts, as well as identifying which group or level of the society likely to be impacted, in which location and when, as well as what party will perform the environmental management.
2) Environmental management can be performed by governmental institutions and the affected/concerned public, provided that there is an agreement with the developing party and that the authority to handle/manage certain significant impacts is outside the jurisdiction of the developing party.
3) Efforts to manage social environmental aspects are performed through the prevention, control and handling of the significant impact sources.
4) The forms of public participation in preventing, handling and controlling impacts can consist of forming an environmental communication forum to handle arising environmental issues, with members from the developing party, the local society affected by the impacts, local government officials, as well as related institutions. Existing social institutions of the society should be utilized in overcoming arising environmental issues.
5) Compensation for the affected public, which is a form of environmental management, should consider mutual advantage.

Appendix 5 states that in formulating the Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL), and specifically in designing the monitoring of social aspects, the developing party should utilize information about the environmental quality obtained from the impacted society. The inclusion of such data should be accompanied by descriptions of the sample taking techniques applied, the number of samples taken and the location from where samples were taken. The environmental monitoring may also be performed by government institutions or the concerned public, provided there is an agreement with the developing party for such monitoring.
