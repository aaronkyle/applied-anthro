### Government Regulation (PP) No. 24 of 2010 re: Forest Area Utilization

SUMMARY

The law sets out requirements in connection with the usage of forest areas. All forest areas concerned are defined in the first article of the law. It limits the usage of forest areas for non-forestry development activities to activities with inevitable strategic aims, such as mining and religious activities.

CONSULTATION

The law does not contain any explicit provision requiring public consultation. There are, however, some restrictions and requirements to forest area usage that could require public consultation.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:
Production forest is “a forest area whose main function is to produce forest products”.
Protected forest is “a forest area whose main function is to protect a life-supporting system to regulate water sources, prevent floods, control erosion, avoid seawater intrusion, and maintain land fertility”.
The use of forest area is “the use of part of forest areas for non-forestry development activities without altering the function and appropriation of the forest areas.”

Articles 2 and 3 state that the use of forest areas is aimed at “controlling the use of part of forest areas for non-forestry development activities.” This applies only to production and/or protected forest areas, and this use shall be done without altering the main function of the forest area by observing borders, periods and environmental conservation. Some of the non-forestry development activities may include public consultation to determine.

Article 4 states that the use of forest areas for non-forestry development activities is limited to activities with inevitable strategic aims. These activities include:
religious activities, including places of worship, funeral places, and spiritual tourism;
mining;
power plants, transmission, and power distribution, as well as new and renewable energy technology;
telecommunication networks, radio broadcast station, and television relay station;
public roads, toll roads and railway tracks;
transportation facilities other than public transportation facilities for the transport of products;
water resource facilities and infrastructures, water installation networks, and clean water and/or waste water channels;
public facilities;
forestry-related industry;
defense and security;
public safety-supporting infrastructure; or
temporary shelters of natural disaster victims.

Article 6 states that the use of forest areas requires forest area lend use permits. One form of such a permit is compensation in the form of land (for provinces where forest area covers less than 30% of river basin areas, islands, and/or provinces. This compensation must be of a ration of at least 1 to 1 for non-commercial purposes, and at least 1 to 2 for commercial purposes.

Article 11 defines the handing over and reforestation of forest areas if compensation is in the form of land as one of the client obligations for being granted a permit in principle for the use of forest areas, with a maximum time period of 2 years (with the possibility of extension based on evaluation).

Article 17 prohibits the holders of forest area lend use permits from transferring permits to other parties without Minister approval, and from using lend use forest areas as collateral to other parties.
