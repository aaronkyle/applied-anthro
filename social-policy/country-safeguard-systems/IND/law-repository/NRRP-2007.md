SCHEDULE
THE NATIONAL REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT
POLICY, 2007

CHAPTER -I

1.Policy

PREAMBLE:

1.1 Provision of public facilities or infrastructure often requires the exercise of legal
powers by the state under the principle of eminent domain for acquisition of private
property, leading to involuntary displacement of people, depriving them of their
land, livelihood and shelter; restricting their access to traditional resource base, and
uprooting them from their socio-cultural environment~ These have traumatic,
psychological and socio-cultural consequences on the affected population which call
for protecting their rights, in particular of the weaker sections of the society including
members of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, marginal farmers and women.
Involuntary displacement of people may be caused by other factors also.

1.2 There is imperative need to recognise rehabilitation and resettlement issues as
intrinsic to the development process formulated with the active participation of the
affected persons, rather than as externally-imposed requirements. Additional
benefits beyond monetary compensation have to be provided to the families affected
adversely by involuntary displacement. The plight of those who do not have legal or
recognised rights over the land on which they are critically dependent for their

Y404Gj{(07 --5

subsistence is even worse. This calls for a broader concerted effort on the part of the
planners to include in the displacement, rehabilitation and resettlement process
framework not only those who directly lose land and other assets but also those who
are affected by such acquisition of assets. The displacement process often poses
problems that make it difficult for the affected persons to continue their earlier
livelihood activities after resettlement. This requires a careful assessment of the
economic disadvantages and social impact of displacement. There must also be a
holistic effort aimed at improving the all round living standards of the affected
people.

1.3 A National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected
Families was formulated in 2003, and it came into force w.e.f. February, 2004.
Experience of implementation of this policy indicates that there are many issues
addressed by the policy which need to be reviewed. There should be a clear
perception, through a careful quantification of the costs and benefits that will accrue
to society at large, of the desirability and justifiability of each project. The adverse
impact on affected families - economic, environmental, social and cultural- needs to
be assessed in a participatory and transparent manner. A national policy must apply
to all projects where involuntary displacement takes place.

1.4 The aim should be to minimise large-scale displacement, as far as possible. Only
the minimum area of land commensurate with the purpose of the project may be
acquired. Also, as far as possible, projects may be set up on wasteland, degraded
land or un-irrigated land. Acquisition of agricultural land for non-agricultural use in
the project may be kept to the minimum; multi-cropped land may be avoided to the
extent possible for such 'purposes, and acquisition of irrigated land, if unavoidable,
may be kept to the minimum. Prior to initiating the acquisition of land for a project,
the appropriate. Government should, inter alia, take into consideration the
alternatives that will (i) minimise the displacement of people due to the acquisition of
land for the project; (ii) minimise the total area of land to be acquired for the project;
and (iii) minimise the acquisition of agricultural land for non-agricultural use in the
project. The options. assessment may be in terms of the alternative project plans,
potentially suitable sites, technological choices available, or a combination of these.
Suitable institutional mechanism should be developed and adopted by the
appropriate Government for carrying out the task in a transparent manner.

1.5 Where large numbers of families are affected, it must be mandatory to do social
impact assessments and provide all required infrastructural facilities and amenities
in the resettlement area. More particularly, where the Scheduled Tribes people are
being displaced in sizeable numbers, a well thought out Tribal Development Plan
must be put in place.

1.6 Furthermore, such a policy must specify clear timeframes within which the
implementation of the rehabilitation package as well as utilization of the land shall
J
"
be accomplished. Also, it should lay down an effective monitoring and grievance
redressal mechanism.
,
v

1.7 It is acknowledged that many State Governments, Public Sector Undertakings or
agencies, and other requiring bodies either have their own Rehabilitation and
Rese~tlement (R&R) policies or are in the process of formulating them. The
provisions of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007 (NRRP-2007)
provide for the basic minimum requirements, and all projects leading to involuntary
displacement of people must address the rehabilitation and resettlement issues
comprehensively. The State Governments, Public Sector Undertakings or agencies,
and other requiring bodies shall be at liberty to put in place greater benefit levels
than those prescribed in the NRRP-2007. The principles of this policy may also apply
to the rehabilitation and resettlement of persons involuntarily displaced permanently
due to any other reason.

CHAPTER - II

2. Objectives of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy

2.1 The objectives of the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy are as
follows:-
(a) to minimise displacement and to promote, as far as possible, non-displacing
or least-displacing alternatives;
(b) to ensure adequate rehabilitation package and expeditious' implementation of
the rehabilitation process with the active participation of the affected families;
(c) to ensure that special care is. taken for protecting the rights of the weaker
sections of society, especially members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes, and to create obligations on the State for their treatment with concern and
sensitivity;
(d) to provide a better standard of.living, making concerted efforts for providing
sustainable income to the affected families;
(e) to integrate rehabilitation concerns into the development planning and
implementation process; and
(f) where displacement is on account of land acquisition, to facilitate harmonious
relationship between the requiring body and affected families through mutual
cooperation.
