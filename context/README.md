## Context

This 'context' folder collects contextual discussions of salient issues in social development, including discussions of [social policy](./social-policy/), [international](./international-law_good-practice/) and [country-](./country-safeguard-systems) law and regulatory frameworks, and [helpful resources for social development practitioners](./implementation-resources/)

In my [references folder](./ref/), I maintain spreadsheet-formatted lists of much of these same data.
