## Context

This [context folder](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context) collects contextual information for salient issues in social development, including discussions of [social policy](./social-policy/), [international](./international-law_good-practice/) and [country-](./country-safeguard-systems) law and regulatory frameworks, and [helpful resources for social development practitioners](./implementation-resources/)

* [`terms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/terms) - Although I find it difficult to maintain, I have been trying to formulate definitions for terms while accounting for their varied usage internationally. [Have a look at this page on the site's front end](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html).
* [`international-law_good-practice`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/international-law_good-practice)
* [`social-policy`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/social-policy)
    - [`ifi-implementation-resources`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/ifi-implementation-resources)
* [`country-safeguard-systems`]()
* [`accountability-mechanisms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/accountability-mechanisms)
* [`thematic-issues`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues)


Note, the [front-end website](http://applied-anthro.com/context/) sees the [`index.html`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/blob/master/context/index.html) for this page.

I also have a [references folder](./ref/) containing spreadsheet-formatted lists of a few topical issues.  These I hope to get into a database application somehow... eventually.
