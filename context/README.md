## Context

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context) collects contextual information pertinent to social development, including discussions of [social policy](./social-policy/), [international-](./international-law_good-practice/) and [country-](./country-safeguard-systems) law and regulatory frameworks, and [helpful resources for social development practitioners](./implementation-resources/).

Main sections currently include:

* [`terms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/terms)
   - Although I find it difficult to maintain, I have been trying to formulate definitions for terms while accounting for their varied usage internationally. [For legacy reasons this page is built differently on the site's front end](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html).
* [`international-law_good-practice`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/international-law_good-practice)
* [`social-policy`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/social-policy)
* [`ifi-implementation-resources`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/ifi-implementation-resources)
* [`country-safeguard-systems`]()</td><td></td></tr>
* [`accountability-mechanisms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/accountability-mechanisms)
* [`thematic-issues`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues)
