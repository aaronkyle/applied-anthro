## Context

This [repository](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context) collects contextual information pertinent to social development, including discussions of [social policy](./social-policy/), [international](./international-law_good-practice/) and [country-](./country-safeguard-systems) law and regulatory frameworks, and [helpful resources for social development practitioners](./implementation-resources/).

Main sections currently include:

<table class="table table-responsive">
<tr><td>[`terms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/terms) </td><td>Although I find it difficult to maintain, I have been trying to formulate definitions for terms while accounting for their varied usage internationally. [Have a look at this page on the site's front end](http://applied-anthro.com/category/terminology.html).</td></tr>
<tr><td>[`international-law_good-practice`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/international-law_good-practice)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>[`social-policy`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/social-policy)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>[`ifi-implementation-resources`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/ifi-implementation-resources)
<tr><td>[`country-safeguard-systems`]()</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>[`accountability-mechanisms`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/accountability-mechanisms)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>[`thematic-issues`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues)</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

Note, the [front-end website](http://applied-anthro.com/context/) sees the [`index.html`](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/blob/master/context/index.html) for this page.

I also have a [references folder](./ref/) containing spreadsheet-formatted lists of a few topical issues.  These I hope to get into a database application somehow... eventually.
