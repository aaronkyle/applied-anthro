Among the first research topics assigned to me as [social development practitioner](/terms/social-development-practitioner/) was to write a 'business case for social development'. I was in my early twenties, new to my job and to the profession, and I had no idea where to start. Clearly, I was given a loaded question. Ten year later (as I continue to make updates on this article), I still don't really have any good answers, though my understanding of how to approach the question has matured with time. 

Here's where I'm at:

### What is business?

Business, to me, is to process of making money and earning profit.  It's an invented, imaginary, and yet actualized concept.

The act of doing business has consequences.  Consequences to those running the business, to clients of the business, suppliers and others directly involved. All who seek to benefit from the business are involved in this the act of profit-making.  Even those who don't interact directly with the business will have indirect interactions, and in a market economy, the idea is that all actors engaged in the economy can bring some form of influence into business operations.

### What is a 'business case'?

A business case is an argument for undertaking some form of action or activity based around the notion that such is either profit-making or that it mitigates liability from loss of profit. 

### What is development?

[Development](/terms/development/) is an imagined concept of how the future can or ought to be shaped from the basis of existing context and human knowledge. A person's understanding of the concept of development is shaped and influenced culturally, experientially, and intellectually.

### What is social development?

[Social development](/terms/social-development/) refers to fields of knowledge and practice at the intersection of development interventions and human societies (which I recognize is a nearly boundless definition). 

### What is a 'business case for social development'?

A business case for social development is an argument that engaging 'social development' activities will help a business to increase profits or mitigate against direct or indirect risks of profit loss.
