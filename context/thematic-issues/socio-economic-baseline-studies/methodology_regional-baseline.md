# Supplementary Baseline Survey

## Context

International development projects often aim to bolster regional and national prosperity, as defined in economic terms (e.g. job creation, enhanced market access).  To deliver on these promises, it is incumbent on project proponents to define and measure the precise nature and form of such position economic change--and to be alert to a project's potential for negative impacts. Especially where a project is conceived as part of national and regional development strategies, it is important to establishing a measurable performance baselines that anticipate and account for project-induced direct, indirect, and cumulative changes to host communities (i.e. structures of governance and societal organization, demographic measures of well-being,  cultural identity, etc).

This document sets out some rationale and methodology for establishing a 'regional baseline' via village and household social surveys and contextual analysis that is both grounded in theory and informed by applied practice implementing action plans for large, complex  projects in developing countries. Underpinning this methodology is a simple 'resource framework' that identifies indicators and questions to measure long-term project induced changes (and to help refine the definition of 'affected communities' throughout the lifetime of this project). This approach provides a coherent and practical way to understand social impacts of the project by combining both household and community-level investigations. The framework acknowledges that household and community well-being is dependent upon a range of tangible and intangible resources and informed by IFC Performance Standards.

To help mitigate the challenges of discussing issues in the abstract, the discussion takes as an example an imaginary development project situated on a remote island group in Indonesia {{ELABORATE}}.


### Identification of Target Baseline Data: Responding to [Anticipated] Positive Impacts

As a major source of regional economic investment, local stakeholders expect the communities near to the client to garner significant positive change from the Project. Some common expectations of a regional extractive industries investment project are:

   * public sector revenues from taxes and royalties
   * improved local training and skills development opportunities
   * increased local skills base
   * increased local labor pool
   * employment creation for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers
   * improved local wage and income levels (including opportunities for local
sourcing and higher prices obtainable for local products)
   * new business development opportunities
   * expanded livelihood opportunities
   * improved housing, water and sanitation
   * improved communications infrastructure
   * improved access to, and expansion of, public infrastructure, services and utilities
   * coordination and alignment of the project to existing national and provincial level health programs, (e.g., TB, HIV/AIDS), and future development plans

Although not all local expectations will be merited by the actual project plans and commitments, the client will invest in economic and social development initiatives in local communities as part of both contractual agreements with the Government of Indonesia as well as in line with a project commitment to sustainable development.  Client regional and local investment is expected to contribute to increased links between local, regional, national, and even international economies. Community members throughout the region, and especially those communities near to the project LSB, are likely to realize increased accessibility and availability of goods and services and deepening economic integration.  Local government authorities are likely to realize increased political power as well as increased responsibility for providing and maintaining adequate social services (health, education, waste management, electricity, water supplies, telecommunications, road systems, etc.).

To adequately monitor how the project is benefiting local community stakeholders and achieving its self-defined sustainable investment targets, the project will collect data for cross-section of indicators of potential direct and indirect impacts.  To effectively measure project performance, these indicators will need to be monitored and evaluated over time.


### Identification of Target Baseline Data: Responding to [Potential] Negative Impacts

Potential impacts associated with the client will most likely be indirect--resulting especially from potential in-migration of 'opportunity seekers' into local communities near to the LSB base.

Potential impacts to local infrastructure, services and utilities deriving from project-induced in-migration include:

   * increased use of existing roads and transportation systems
   * increased pressure on education and health services and infrastructure
   * increased pressure on waste management systems
   * increased demand for electricity, water supplies, and sanitation
   * increased demand on communications networks
   * increased demand for housing
   * increased use of/demand for community, religious, and recreational facilities
   * unplanned and uncontrolled development of squatter settlements

Consequent negative (indirect) impacts of the client to local economies, livelihood strategies of affected communities, and health contexts might thus be:

   * increased poverty deriving from increased cost of living (inflation in costs of land, food, fuel and housing)
   * increased indebtedness
   * increased economic vulnerability for marginal groups (women, elderly, disabled, etc.)
   * increased dependence on cash-based economy to meet needs
   * reduced influence of traditional beliefs and knowledge
   * loss of cultural heritage
   * economic displacement derived from increased competition for economic resources and employment (e.g., loss of productive land to urban settlement, increased demand for housing and higher property prices)
   * deterioration of local subsistence production systems (e.g., ecosystem services)
   * changes in nutritional status
   * proliferation of communicable diseases (including sexually transmitted infections, respiratory infections, waterborne diseases)
   * inadequate public hygiene facilities
   * increased incidence of accidents and fatalities, such as may be associated with project traffic or other hazards (e.g., spills and releases)
   * increased air and marine traffic
   * increased exposure to potentially hazardous materials (road dust; air pollution related to industrial activity, vehicles, cooking, heating, or other forms of combustion/ incineration; landfill refuse or incineration ash; effects of other project-related solvents, paints, oils)
   * insufficient number of health centers, staff and medical supplies (e.g., inadequate staffing levels and competencies, or technical capabilities of health care facilities)
  * loss of indigenous medicines and unique cultural health practices
  * reduced public safety during construction
  * increased violence and security concerns related to psychosocial impacts (manifested via substance misuse and abuse of drugs, alcohol, smoking; depression and changes to social cohesion, etc.)

Example indicators that the project is inducing negative impacts on local communities:

   * increased food scarcity
   * diminishing affordability of housing and/or construction materials
   * increasing indebtedness
   * increasing disease epidemics
   * increasing occurrence and practice of social vices
   * increasing domestic violence and rape
   * intra- and inter- group jealousy
   * rising crime and violence
   * heightening or changing ethnic tensions
   * breakdown of law and order
   * increasing probability of public security force intervention
   * increasing prevalence of sex workers
   * changing prevalence of entrepreneurs (new businesses)
   * increasing prevalence of predatory / informal money lenders
   * price inflation


### Identification of Target Baseline Data: Accounting and Evaluating for Project-Induced Change

It is also important to bear in mind that the ramifications of project-induced impacts to local communities are rarely clear in advance. It is therefore important to measure socio-economic changes that may have either 'positive' and 'negative' ramifications for project-affected people and communities.  For example, consider the potential for the following changes to have both positive and negative ramifications for different stakeholder groups and population sub-sets:

   * monetization of remote rural economies, improving purchasing power and increasing trade
   * changing local and regional business development opportunities
   * opportunities to build community organizational structures
   * increased individual, household, and community empowerment stemming from increased income and wealth
   * increased attention and input by government authorities, NGOs, etc.
   * increased local tax revenue levels
   * changing role of traditional medical providers

A comprehensive and robust baseline survey framework must therefore take into account the need to monitor a variety of socio-economic contexts in order to anticipate and evaluate the potential for unintended direct and indirect impacts.


### Anticipating the Emergence of New Stakeholder Groups

client community stakeholder groups vary considerably in terms of their origin and ethno-cultural affinities, *soa* and familial-affinity groups, languages and dialects, religious affiliations, economic occupations and profession, and in numerous other ways.  The socio-cultural diversity of Tanimbarese people and communities are simultaneously a hallmark characteristic of the region and a perennial source of political tensions.  Any spontaneous migration and settlement of humans in the area can be expected to introduce a range of new concerns for current local inhabitants, such as regards the adequacy of public infrastructure, services, utilities, housing, sustainable resource management, and other issues related to the lists of potential positive and negative impacts listed above.

A rough typology of potential new and expanding (non-local) stakeholder groups that may emerge as either a direct result of the client, or due to public anticipation of its arrival include:

   * returning family, extended family members, and former residents of the area, including opportunistic returnees seeking improved living conditions and employment, or opportunities to provide goods and services
   * project employees from outside the project area (expected to have little interaction with local community members)
   * temporary or permanent workers / laborers employed by the project or its contractors
   * unskilled, semi-skilled or skilled people seeking direct or indirect employment or entrepreneurial opportunities
   * migrant entrepreneurs, including  small and medium enterprise owners, seeking to capture business opportunities associated with increased demand for goods and services associated with the local population’s higher levels of disposable income
   * service providers to the project
   * entrepreneurs and SMEs; aiming to secure contracts to provide goods and services
   * traders aiming to capture substantial increases in disposable income through provision of goods
   * money lenders encouraging community members to borrow money under conditions not familiar to them; their increasing economic power is often associated with co-opting local political leaders and elites
   * commercial sex workers

CCCS would like to note that the delay in project disclosure about its activities (and the limitations thereof, such as limitations in local investment and workforce recruitment) risks building unrealistic expectations about potential project benefits, and therefore also risks further exposing local stakeholders to speculative in-migration.

A well-structured social baseline framework can help to identify and account for different forms of in-migration by examining demographic composition of income-earning activities, changing compositions of economic classes and changing access to economic activities and income streams.  While such measurements are extremely important at villages and towns proximate to the project site, it is also critical for the client to measure and evaluate for project-induced impacts in areas further afield, as such may still fit squarely within the project's 'area of social influence'.


### On-Going Impact Identification and Analysis: Proactive Planning to Enable a Robust M&E Framework

The ESMS social baseline utilizes a household and community resources framework as a tool to organize data to facilitate impact identification and analysis and to help inform the on-going development and refinement of action plans for impact mitigation and sustainable social development. This 'resources framework' approach to data organization draws on social research theory and has been applied to IFC client projects. Existing social baseline provide a partial dataset to inform analysis using the 'resources framework' approach; ESMS supplimentary baseline field studies seek to help fill remaining gaps ahead of the social impact assessment studies.

There are eight categories of resources under the framework:

1. human resources
2. social resources
3. cultural and religious resources
4. environmental resources
5. natural resources
6. livelihood resources
7. housing resources
8. basic services


#### Human Resources

The availability of labor, education and skills determine how a household can exploit livelihood resources available to it. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money.The health and nutrition of the family are fundamental to a minimum level of well-being. Households with limited labour availability consisting of children, the elderly and infirm are more vulnerable to project impacts.

#### Social Resources

Trust in institutions is essential for social cohesion and well-being. Households form part of a community within a traditional and political setting. Households are typically dependent on a combination of family, community, traditional and political networks to gain access to land, housing and livelihood resources. Local community, traditional and political institutions can provide safety and security for households in time of natural and political disaster.


#### Cultural and Religious Resources

Common belief systems frame the existence of communities and provide psychological security to households. Culture and religion provide an identity and structure to households to engage and support one another.

#### Environmental Resources

Households and communities depend on the biophysical environment to maintain their health, safety and livelihoods. Disruptions to the quality of air, water, soil can impact negatively on the health and stability of households.

#### Natural Resources

Access to land, freshwater bodies, forests, marine and other natural resources is critical for the world’s population in providing ecosystem services including timber, medicines, food, and genetic resources, among others. Access to these resources is governed by community, traditional and political institutions.

#### Livelihood Resources

Livelihood activities (land, marine, wage and enterprise-based), remittances, bartering and labour exchanges contribute to household incomes and assets. Livelihood activities may include cropping, grazing, hunting, fishing, gathering, etc. and may derive from both agricultural and on-agricultural sources. A household’s access to livelihood resources is dependent on social, traditional and political institutions.

#### Housing Resources

Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people’s lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. Shelter is one of the most basic requirements of any household that can be a major determinant of health. The tenure to residential land and dwelling is critical to guaranteeing shelter and livelihoods to households.

#### Access to Basic Services

Access to basic services including water supply, sanitation, education and health is a determinant of a household’s health and ability to exploit livelihood opportunities.


## Supplementary Social Baseline Study Design

The following discussion of field selection design methods for ensuring adequate site selection and sampling are based on a rough proximate working definition of the client 'area of social influence' as the regency of Maluku Tenggara Barat (MTB). [CCCS encourages the project to revise its definition of 'area of social influence' to include parts of Maluku Barat Daya (MBD), especially communities from Babar Island claiming a 'stake' in the project and its benefits.] CCCS proposes a cost-effective approach to build on the existing social baseline data for MTB by drawing on supplemental secondary sources such as census data, socio-economic and health surveys and by conducting primary research in the form of village and household level surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

MTB is characterized by two major population concentrations--one in the south, centered around Saumlaki, and the other in the north, centered around Larat.  These population centers developed partially in response to historic political rivalries. Due in part to the client plans to situate its Logistics Supply Base in Olilit, and owing partially to regional planning and investment decisions of the MTB government (such as the new airport near Saumlaki), the current focus of previous client baseline studies has been on villages in southern MTB. CCCS' proposed methodology extends the scope of study to account for the potential of project-induced impacts also to northern village--gathering data especially that can help to evaluate potential impacts induced by speculative in-migration, as well as other indirect and cumulative impacts.


### Determination of a 'Representative Sample'

%% {[NOT YET INTEGRATED]} %%

The total number of villages in MTB in the year 2010 is being used as a proxy measure to establish a representative sample within the project's 'social area of impact'.  The client acknowledges that it will be a project of regional significance, and definition of 'area of influence' will continue to be reformulated and refined during the process of social impact assessment.  The significance of this measurement is to establish an appropriate survey size.

FIGURE: 1
%%{[ADJUST TABLE]}%%

----

	Population Size	Confidence Level	Degree of Accuracy	Target Sample Size
MTB total # villages*	72	45%	0.05	28

----

To help ensure that the survey team interacts directly with a 'representative sample' of the regional area of influence, CCCS grouped villages according to arithmetic quartiles by population and sought to balance site selection accordingly.

FIGURE: 2
%%{[ADJUST TABLE]}%%

----
Calculation of [MTB quartiles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZLdBOF8MAJGKAAxh2nlVLznIrmXUX2CRCbkDPKGgLc/edit?pli=1#gid=1619742010)

MTB kabupaten population, mean: 105,341/71 = 1483.676 [1484]

No. MTB villages above mean =  28

//  re-factored mean for top half = 71,232=/28 [2,544]

* top [\geq 2,544] = 5 villages
* mid-top [2,544 - 1,484] = 23 villages

No. MTB villages below mean = 43

//  re-factored mean for top half (mean re-factored) = 34,809/43 [793]

* mid-bottom  [1,483 - 793] = 18 villages
* bottom = [\leq 792] = 26 villages

----

This methodology extends the number of study villages to achieve a more balanced and representative sample, as well as to better demonstrate how the project is attending to the IFC prescript to ensure that the impact assessment process accounts especially for 'vulnerable communities' (i.e., by giving suitable weighting to the representation of small and isolated communities that may be exposed to project-induced indirect impacts, such as price inflation).

{[ADJUST STATEMENT]}
As calculated in the table above and reflected in the graphics below, the distribution of ESMS social baseline study locations achieves a rough approximation of regional composition with respect to population size.

FIGURE: 2
{[INSERT EXCEL IMAGE]}

Primary baseline data collection in each village sets numerical targets for the number of survey participants according to confidence values of 80% and margin of error calculations varying between 0.25 and 0.5. CCCS will use a combination of household questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions to effect a rapid rural appraisal that reaches representative sample population targets //%%{[SECTION]}%%//.  The target number of participants for FGD sessions is calculated according to MTB 2010 village population quartile values. ESMS supplementary social baseline implementation schedules were created by calculating village days according to the estimated number of FGDs that can be completed in one day (6 total; refer to //%%{[SECTION]}%%//).

%%{INSERT: [Sample Definition]}%%


### Selection of Study Sites

CCCS and INPEX agreed to the following parameters for supplementary baseline site selection:

   * sample size should seek to achieve a defensible statistical representation of the social field; no less than 35% confidence level for regional "area of influence" (minimum of 17 villages)
   * full representation of directly affected communities [equivalent to 'priority directly-affected communities' (PDAC)in the terminology of the client *Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan* (PCDP)]
   * partial representation (ca. 40% - 80%) of areas likely to be exposed to project-induced direct and indirect socio-economic impacts ('directly-affected communities' DAC)
   * partial representation (ca. 10% - 40%) of areas that may indirectly be affected by project-induced socio-economic change, or those area where there is a vocal stakeholder perception or belief that such changes may occur ('indirectly-affected communities' IAC)

Additional parameters influencing CCCS' proposed field sites selection include:

  - proximity and distance from key project activity zones, especially the administrative and economic center of Saumlaki, the capital of MTB, as well as the planned on-shore LSB site and port facilities in neighboring Olilit Village.
  - distances from port facilities / accessibility by regular forms transportation [proximity to transportation hubs affects the likelihood a village will experience in-migration]
  - distance from healthcare and treatment facilities [availability of, and access to, health and educational services affect the extent to which communities' vulnerability may be impacted by the project]
  - available production land in village [derived from BPN statistics, this measurement indicates the potential of a village community to expand agricultural output in response to added population pressures]
 - due consideration of existing social, demographic, linguistic, geographical and economic data [MTB has several distinctive language groups, the number of which is a matter of scholarly debate; at least five major groups can be distinguished]
 - due consideration of timing, capacity constraints and the logistics of access

CCCS' proposed selection criteria seeks to extend the geographic coverage of study sites to better account for potential project-induced changes in northern parts of MTB and other more distant villages--such as those that may be affected by speculative flows of immigrants or particularly remote and impoverished villages that are relatively more vulnerable to shocks of regional economic change.  We recognize, however, that  much of the west coast of MTB's Yamdena Island is not accessible by road, and a number of populated islands in the northwest and northeast of Yamdena cannot be readily reached by means of sea transport meeting INPEX' quality, health and safety standards.  CCCS will work with INPEX to revise and finalize final field site selection.

Following the above parameters and considerations, the CCCS team recommends selection of the below villages for village-level collection of supplementary baseline data:

ID#	Village	Kecamatan


81-01-43-006	Adaut	Selaru
81-01-54-005	Alusi Kelaan	Kormomolin

### 'Triangulation' of data sources

'Triangulation' is a term used by social scientists to describe the the technique of integrating multiple lines of analysis to ensure the integrity of data sources and analytical practices. The term 'triangulation' is borrowed from navigational techniques for locating a single point in multi-dimensional space by evaluating the convergence of measurements from other distinct points. The idea is that one can be more confident with a result of data collection and analysis if different methods lead to the same outcomes. Triangulation can be used in both quantitative (validation) and qualitative (inquiry) studies and is particularly well suited when one seeks to establish the credibility of qualitative analyses. Triangulation of information also helps overcome limitations imposed on qualitative studies via sampling criteria for reliability and validity combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and empirical materials, researchers can hope to overcome the weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from single method, single-observer and single-theory studies.

The ESMS supplementary social baseline studies compile following sources of data to facilitate triangulation of data to inform social impact analysis:

  1. government statistics
  2. limited household surveys
  3. focus group discussions (FGD) / participatory rapid appraisal (PRA)
  4. key informant interviews


#### Analysis of Existing Government Data

*Badan Pusat Statistik* (BPS) of Maluku Tenggara Barat works with kecamatan-level governments to produce annual reports of socio-economic and health data in a series referred to collectively in this methodology as the *Badan Pusat Statistik* (BPS) *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series.  A variety of government agencies supply indicator data for the *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series, and much of the data they provide can be utilized to help inform ongoing analysis of potential project-induced impacts to local communities. Initial comparative analysis performed on all MTB *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka*  demonstrate that reporting is  uneven for most socio-economic variables--to an extent that severely limits current capacity to use these data in studies of social change and sustainable development.  The distribution of topics varies greatly and few variable measures are uniformly disaggregated to the village level. Even fewer variables desegregate according to gender. The varying integrity of each underlying dataset and mistakes resulting from the process of government reporting and client re-capture are also processes certain to have introduced errors.   [All analysis therefore involves substantial interpretation and application of professional judgment.]

CCCS is contributing on-going work to re-constitute, clean, and verify MTB government village-level data in a manner that is helpful for social analysis.  We will continue integrating government data sources as they become available to us.  Allowes are made within the scope of this methodology to pursue data access by working directly with key stakeholder informants. %%{[REFERENCE METHODOLOGY SECTION]}%%.  CCCS will continue to seek access to data from the 2010 Indonesian Census, which records to the household level across the country.


#### Questionnaire Household Surveys

A questionnaire household survey is a method of direct data collection. General census surveys tend to ask a large number of questions in order to describe comparatively large populations.  A questionnaire household survey is a shorter form of questionnaire survey that focuses on a narrowly-defined set of targeted inquiries and collects data from only a small representative sample of respondents. Close-ended  design helps to facilitate a quantifiable dataset for subsequent statistical analysis, but these surveys are limited in how their results can credibly be generalized or extrapolated. Short surveys are therefore used primarily to augment and verify existing data sources. ESMS questionnaire surveys will therefore focus on obtaining nuanced quantification and measurements from respondents that are less likely to vary according to individual circumstances (e.g., costs, distances, time, and common forms of infrastructure) but reflect community-wide practice or experience. //%% {[IMPROVE]} %%//

**Characterization of Questionnaire Surveys**

* structured
* semi-random (tracking households interviewed, if possible)

---

ESMS supplementary baseline questionnaire surveys will last approximately one hour in duration. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 1 minute (60 questions/hour)--although it is possible for a skilled enumerator and rapid respondent to make it through 1 question every 10 seconds (360 questions/hour).

Enumerators will ask as many questions as possible within that hour according to a structured interview schedule organized in priority 'modules'. In situations where enumerators are able to work through a multitude of questions, they will be asked to work through (and select) different sheets in order of priority.

Order of priority for structured surveys is as follows:

- identity distribution
- livelihoods
- living conditions
- health / security conditions
- access to basic services
- territorial ties / population mobility
- household composition
- asset ownership

The ESMS baseline schedule anticipates that one field enumerator can conduct 6 one-hour surveys in one day, and to keep this pace for a maximum of three days between rests.  Combining days of rest with transportation between and around study sites to maximize productive time, each period of ESMS field survey can only be reasonably planned for periods of up to four weeks in duration.

Dedicating two enumerators per team full-time to this task would allow for up to a maximum of 468 one-on-one interviews to be gathered during fieldwork. Sampling 468 people provides only ca. 60% confidence values for a populations of 105,341 [MTB total population according to BPS 2010 data] at a 0.018% degree of accuracy. This means that questionnaire surveys cannot be relied on alone to describe village socio-economic conditions with a high degree of certainty that the results reflect normal distributions (e.g., incidents of disease within a village).


#### Focus Group Discussions / Participatory Rapid Appraisal

Focus group discussions utilize an interactive group setting to facilitate rapid data collection, especially on topics that can be explored in depth via participant interaction. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) are typically small and informal gatherings where a facilitator guides conversations on pre-establish topics of interest. The forum encourages complexity of responses, behaviors and motivations. FGDs also provide contextual data and immediate feedback on research design and methodology.

----

**Characterization of FGD / PRA**

* semi-structured
* targeted population groups

----

As indicated above, representative village profiles cannot be rapidly generated based entirely on structured, one-on-one questionnaire surveys.  For this reason, the ESMS supplementary social baseline field team will utilize focus group discussions (FGDs) and participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) as alternative forms of data collection.

The advantages of FGD and PRA over questionnaire survey is that they can allow for the simultaneous collection of feedback from a number of respondents in a format that is also conducive to allowing respondents to collectively deliberate and adjust their responses--often improving the robustness and accuracy of the results.  FGD and PRA forms of data gathering are especially well suited to situations where respondents are being asked to enumerate varieties of different resources or when being asked to recall information about collective activities and shared cultural beliefs and values (such as the location of sacred sites, claims to communal land, or areas of cultural significance). FGDs can also be helpful in identifying points of disagreement between individual stakeholders and investigating the degree of shared understanding on a topic. FGDs are not, however, a formal means of consensus or decision-making and facilitators are cautioned not to attempt to resolve conflicts or to formalize any decision or course of action.

The disadvantages of FGD and PRA relative to questionnaire surveys is that oftentimes fewer questions can be covered on a single topic (since greater time and attention is spent on deliberating and refining answers). FGD and PRA are also more heavily dependent on the skill of their facilitators and data-recorders to capture 'survey' style data (such as the number of people living in houses built from different types of materials).  For this reason, FGD and PRA discussion topics and priority questions need to be carefully designed and practiced in advance of fieldwork.  Additionally, both the facilitators and the data-recorders need to be closely familiar with the full range of target questions and capable of shifting quickly among priority topics according to respondent interests. FGDs are less useful for gathering statistical data. It is also more challenging to conduct focus groups when language barriers are insurmountable or when the situation is not under the facilitator’s control.

FGD sessions will last approximately 2 hours. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 3 minutes (20 questions/hour; 40 total), though it is possible to realize a response rate around 1 question every 2 minutes (30 questions/hour; 60 total). The ESMS team would be expected to be able to conduct between 3 and 4 FGD/PRA sessions on any given day.  Over the duration of a one-month study, the range of expected FGD/PRA studies is between 57 and 76 individual sessions.  Limiting the number of respondents for each session to a maximum of 16 people, the top potential number of respondents to be interviewed via FGD/PRA sessions is 1,216 people in total.

The order of topical priority for focus group discussions will follow a similar overall progression as that of the questionnaire survey questions. For each participating village community a standard set of topics will be raised in gender disaggregated FGD/PRA with community members covering key areas of Project interest, and likely impact, including (a) socio-economic livelihoods (b) cultural heritage and the role of tradition/ dispute resolution in the village (c) health and other services; and (d) community security.  

In addition to the standard set of topics, FGD facilitators will have discretion in selecting among one or more site specific themes to explore according to  particular conditions and circumstances of interest to FDD participants. Example topics include:

  * marine / coastal focused livelihoods
  * government services and access
  * livelihood opportunities and development constraints
  * gender, family and health

The ESMS supplementary baseline survey will utilize FGDs to gather data and insights from targeted stakeholder groups, including women, the disabled and vulnerable as well as youth groups and the elderly. FGD facilitators will create an environment in which stakeholders feel comfortable to share their views openly—providing a safe space and a chance for everyone speak freely.


#### Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)

Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) are one-on-one interviews and discussions. KIIs are a common technique for gathering specific information.  Such information may range from insights into stakeholder perspectives on such issues as social dynamics within a particular community or internal politics within a company or government agency.  KIIs rely on the knowledge and connections of particular individuals, such as sources of authority about a certain topic, or those with special access to data. KIIs are among the most commonly used methods of data collection for ‘needs assessment’, ethnographic or sociological research, monitoring and evaluation, and may also factor into safety audits and human rights monitoring.

Order of priority for targeted interviews is as follows:

- general census and socio-economic data
   * focusing especially on interviews with adat leaders, elderly women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), teachers, local business owners and other local notables

- health data
   * accessing inputs from healthcare practitioners (including Puskesmas representatives) and traditional healers

- information on sources and costs of basic services (access to water, food, medical treatment, and education)
   * focusing especially on interviews with  women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), commercial agencies supplying services; government agencies supplying services

- productivity of local markets by resource type
   * accessing inputs from suppliers, merchants, traders, local business owners and other local notables

- information on sources and costs of building supplies and materials
   * focusing especially on interviews with people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), local homeowners and local business owners


INPEX has requested CCCS--in addition to household surveys and FGD/PRA session--to gather updated socio-economic and census data from local institutions and government agencies.   ESMS supplementary baseline field team will dedicate at least one field researcher to pursuing secondary data access from local authorities and institutions.

It is very likely possible to improve coverage of available socio-economic data for baseline study by requesting materials directly from data suppliers.  The following government and civic groups supply the raw data upon which all *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series are generated :

1.	Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika Saumlaki / Stasiun Meteorologi Saumlaki
1.	Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Desa Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Badan Pusat Statistik
	- Badan Pusat Statistik ( Pemetaan Wilayah )
	- Badan Pusat Statistik (PODES)
	- BPS dan BPMD Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Data Dasar Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kesehatan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Pendidikan, Pemuda, dan Olahraga Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Perindustrian, Perdagangan dan Koperasi Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Pertanian Tanaman Pangan Holtikultura dan Peternakan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Sosial, Tenaga Kerja, dan Transmigrasi Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Tanaman Pangan, Holtikultura, dan Peternakan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Kantor Badan Pertanahan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Kantor Cabang Telkom Saumlaki

%%{[INSERT ANNEX 3: Comparison of Needed Government Indicator Data by Kecamatan and Topical Category]}%%

Local-level (*kecamaten*) government agencies currently support data collection for some districts. To the extent possible, the  ESMS team will also solicit access to data from the *Kantor Kecamatan* and from and *Puskesmas* facility located within target study villages


### Field Study Implementation - Logistical Planning

#### Provisional Itinerary of Activities On Site - Prescriptive Considerations for Project Planning

Field study implementation will following a prescribed agenda of activities that can be roughly understood as follows:

1. Day 1: Arrival, Introductions and Initial Investigations

* The ESMS team arrives in the study village and meets with the local Village Head (*Kepala Desa*) and other local notables to introduce the team members and to review the purpose and scope of survey activities.  Team members sub-divide themselves into data collection groups, with some individuals designated to facilitate FGDs/PRAs, some to serve as FGD data recorders, and some designated with responsibility for conducing questionnaire surveys. ESMS team co-leads work with field team members to ensure that data collection is being carried out appropriately. ESMS team co-leads also work independently with local stakeholder to address specific data-collection objectives, defined per *kecamatan*.

1. Days 2,3 & 4 [according to sample requirements]

* Household questionnaires and FGD/PRA session continue, addressing thematic issues of interest (including FGD session with vulnerable groups / special interest stakeholder groups)
* On the final day of studies, the ESMS team prepares for departure.  In some cases, the field team may not be able to stay overnight in a target study village; in such cases the team will prepare daily transportation bewteen the field site and the site of local accommodations.


#### Factoring for time and transportation

In the following provisional field schedule, consideration has been given to contingency planning and the likelihood of delays and the need for scheduling revisions.

#### Preliminary Schedules

CCCS proposes that supplementary baseline field studies occur in two parts. Splitting the survey into two parts accounts for the expanded  scope of the study and accomodates different logistical challenges that correspond with seasonal change--particularly challenges associated with sea travel. A phased approach also allows for follow-up on data requests made to specific government partners.

The first round of fieldwork will be occur in March 2015 and will focus on village communities on the island of Yamdena that are accessible by road. The second round of fieldwork will occur in June 2015 and will focus on villages on Selaru Island as well as commmunities in the north of Yamdena Island and on Larat Island. **ANNEX 5** provides an overview of study groupings according to fieldwork component; it further shows how study sites will be distributed across ESMS study teams. **ANNEX 6** provides a detailed (daily) schedule for ESMS team site visits.

### Post-Fieldwork Data Processing and Reporting

Compilation and reporting of the supplementary baseline results will be produced progressively, with initial processing undertaken after the first period of fieldwork. The final ESMS supplementary baseline report will be completed after the second phase of field research. Quantitative statistical analysis of questionnaire data will be combined with context and thematic analysis of the FGD material. CCCS will also make allowances for advanced statistical analysis to be undertaken at ANU (Australia).

An amalgamated report on the findings of the Supplementary Baseline Survey will be submitted by 15 September 2015. Final report preparation and peer review will be supported by CCCS Senior Social Specialist, Dr. Andrew McWilliam.
