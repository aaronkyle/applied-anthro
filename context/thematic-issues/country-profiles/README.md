This directory contains work that I've done to create 'country profiles' on social safegauard topics.  Country profiles are thematic reviews of legal, regulatory, and insititonal contexts pertinant to developmenal practice. I distinguish work on country profiles from that on country safeguard systems largely because my past work in this area has been project-specific and represented by certain artefacts, such as the work that I conducted in 2014: 'Indigeous Peoples Country Profile in the Russian Federation'. I may revisit this distinction later.

Also related are some [literature lists](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/blob/master/ref/literature-lists.md) and [reference materials](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/ref/subset_indigenous-peoples/).

Looks like the repository lacks structure in terms of how it deals with 'country profiles'.  Attempt to bring this together into country systems.
