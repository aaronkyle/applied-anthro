This repository contains work that I've done to create 'country profiles' on social safegauard topics.  Country profiles are thematic reviews of legal, regulatory, and insititonal contexts pertinant to developmenal practice.
 
Currently only one document is reproduced here: 'Indigeous Peoples Country Profile in the Russian Federation.  This document is an artefact of work that I conducted in 2014 (so it's quite dated already -- as I am updating this repository currently in 2018).
