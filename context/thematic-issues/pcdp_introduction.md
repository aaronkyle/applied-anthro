## Introduction to the PCDP

Projects operators seeking finance from international financial institutions must commit to proactive and ongoing communication with all agencies, organisations, and individuals potentially affected by the project. To formalise this commitment, the public consultation and disclosure plan (PCDP) sets forth processes of stakeholder consultation to support project design and to assist with sustainable and socially-responsive development throughout project construction and operations.  The goal of the PCDP is to ensure that adequate and timely project information is provided to stakeholders and that sufficient opportunity is provided for concerns and opinions to be voiced. [^1]

Simply put, the PCDP is a strategy of engagement to seek a social license to operate from the surrounding community—a community upon whose acceptance project success is predicated and upon whom project activities will have a profound effect. 

Moreover, projects operators must commit to a socially and culturally appropriate approach to consultation and disclosure that is characterised by adequate information sharing with project-affected people and other stakeholders in a clear and timely manner and commensurate with the level of Project risks and impacts.

This example PCDP is written to demonstrate how a project operator can demonstrate conformity with the Equator Principles and the Performance Standards of IFC. 

The pages that follow acknowledge applicable IFC, international, and domestic regulatory frameworks for stakeholder consultation. They continue by describing how a project can fulfil obligations for effective community and stakeholder engagement throughout the lifetime of the Project.

This PCDP sets forth guidelines for public consultation and disclosure to help systematize stakeholder engagement and to ensure that all interested parties are kept informed of project activities and their potential effects—both positive and negative. This document should be read as the start of a continuous process—one that is continuously reviewed and adapted to respond to changing project conditions.
