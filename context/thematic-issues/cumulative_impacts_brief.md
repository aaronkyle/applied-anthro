# Accounting for Cumulative Impacts: Notes for development practitioners

*The concept of '[climate change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change)' is [a prevalent topic in popular discourses concerning the environmental impacts of international development processes](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?ref=topics).  Yet to address 'climate change' (or even to demonstrate definitively that humans are inducing changes to climatic patterns) is practically impossible, and [often wrought with political controversy (especially in the United States)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy). By contrast, the 'cumulative impacts' (or 'cumulative effects') of development projects on the environment, ecology, and socio-economic context of communities are consequences that can be quantified and addressed. Work on assessing the cumulative impacts of development projects is becoming increasingly important to related processes of adequate and informed decision-making and risk management. This article provides a brief account of issues and challenges for performing 'cumulative impact assessments'.*

Development projects and policies invariably entail environmental, social and economic impacts. Typically, the impacts of development initiatives are assessed and addressed individually&mdash;as the result or consequence of a single project or policy. Yet the ramifications that any given project or policy may have rarely occur in isolation. That is, when combined with the impacts of other proximate activities and multiplied over time, project operations may be of greater significance than they are assessed to be in isolation or at a specific moment in time.

Imagine, for example, that a farming community, a hydroelectric plant and a coal mine are all situated in proximity to a long river, which eventually flows into the ocean. All these operations impact the river in different ways. The farm draws water for irrigation and the fertilizers it uses may seep from its fields into the river water. The turbines of the hydroelectric plant interrupt the spawning and movement patterns of river fish and contribute to changes in the marine ecology. Particulate matter form the coal mine reduces the light that can pass through river water and changes its PH-balance. While each of these impacts alone may not necessarily be considered 'significant' on their own, taken together they could potentially give rise to serious consequences such as loss of life at the river’s estuary. These consequences may be further exacerbated by periodic or seasonal events, such as periods of drought or heavy rainfall or extreme fluctuations in temperature.

The term 'cumulative impacts' refers to successive, incremental, and/or combined effects of actions or events ([Franks et al. 2010:8](https://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/publications/cumulative-impacts-guide), p.8). They are understood to be unattributable to a single source or project, but rather as the aggregate impact of all activities occurring within a given area. Typically, cumulative impacts arise in two ways:

1. Two separate developments cause two impacts of the same kind that, taken together, significantly exacerbates the severity of the impact; and 
2. Two separate developments cause two different types of impacts that interact to give rise to a whole new kind of impact (in what is called *impact interaction*).

In public discourse, the cumulative impacts of project operations on the environment tend to be more prominently discussed than those related to social and economic concerns. Yet all three kinds are inter-related, especially when seen over time. The cumulative impacts of polluting emissions from industrial activities (albeit popularly considered to be an "environmental issue"), for instance, could result in deteriorating respiratory health among local communities when taking into account the total emissions of multiple projects in a region and compounding exposure over time. Indigenous Peoples communities tend to be especially vulnerable to inter-related cumulative impacts, as many indigenous communities are dependent on natural resources to support their lives, cultural practices, and livelihoods.


## International trends toward increasing regulation of cumulative impact assessments and related challenges

To successfully evaluate and mitigate cumulative impacts often requires inter-disciplinary cooperation across (often competing!) projects and sectors. Parties may agree on the importance of avoiding and mitigating cumulative impacts and yet still disagree about how to address them. In CCCS’ experience, project proponents can be reluctant to take on the challenge of conducting cumulative impact assessments out of concern that if they identify potentially significant risks and/or negative consequences from the amalgamated activities of regional actors and activities (past, present and planned), stakeholders might very well hold them *alone* accountable for addressing these impacts&mdash;even if no other parties agree with their findings or offer support. Addressing cumulative impacts is further complicated by the challenges of demonstrating complex causal relationships, the concurrence of impacts, and the need for cross-disciplinary expertise ([Kay et al. 2010:1](http://cardi.cornell.edu/cals/devsoc/outreach/cardi/publications/upload/Policy_Brief_Sept10-draft05.pdf), p. 1).

Over the past decade, international financial institutions (IFIs) are increasingly mandating 'cumulative impact assessments' within the context of project Environmental and Social Impact Analysis (ESIA). The IFC’s *Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks* (PS1) is one such example&mdash;linking the scope of such cumulative impacts to the definition of the 'area of influence' for which a project ESIA must account ([IFC 2012](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3be1a68049a78dc8b7e4f7a8c6a8312a/PS1_English_2012.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 3-4). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2009 *Safeguard Policy Statement* also requires client environmental assessment processes to identify potential cumulative impacts ([ADB 2009](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2009/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf), p. 30), as does the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in its *Performance Requirement 1: Environmental and Social Appraisal and Management* ([EBRD 2009](http://www.ebrd.com/environment/e-manual/r16eia.html), p. 16; this provision is [required for Category A Projects](http://www.ebrd.com/environment/e-manual/r16eia.html)). Similarly, the European Commission released a directive in 2013 mandating cumulative impacts in the context of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), citing case rulings of the European Court of Justice. It further prohibits development practitioners from evading the need to assess cumulative impacts by dividing projects into individual components ([EU Commission 2013](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/pdf/eia_case_law.pdf), p. 26).

Establishing requirements for cumulative impact assessment via international financing provisions, however, is problematic in the sense that not all actors operating in a given area will seek international financing. The establishment of regulatory and/or legal frameworks for managing cumulative impacts is ultimately an issue of governance. The best means for addressing cumulative impacts, therefore, is for government regulators to establish robust frameworks for cumulative impact assessment and then to facilitate multi-party dialogue and cooperation. A good example of such a framework is [Canada’s Northwest Territories Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program](http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/programs/nwt-cimp) (NWT CIMP)&mdash;a federally-funded program started in 1999 that takes a community-based approach to impact identification and monitoring. Communities are involved in the design, analysis, and interpretation of environmental impacts in their area, and also play a role in impact monitoring and evaluation reporting. NWT CIMP relies on the involvement of both the federal and regional governments as well as communities affected by environmental impacts. The challenge, of course, is that such public-private collaboration depends significantly on the capacity of government and on the continuity of policy regimes.



## Guidance notes for development practitioner when accounting for cumulative impacts

Common to most (if not all) of the approaches to identifying and evaluating cumulative impacts recommended by the above-identified IFIs for development practitioners is to define 'Valued Social and Environmental Components' (VECs). This process should result in the establishment if a threshold against which the condition and sustainability of the VECs is to be measured and monitored. According to the 2013 IFC *[Good Practice Handbook on Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES)*, for instance, conducting 'Cumulative Impact Analysis' (CIA) within the context of an 'Environmental and Social Impact Assessment' (ESIA) should occur according to the following six-step process, from scoping to management:

* Step 1: Implement scoping activities to determine the project’s spatial and temporal boundaries, and any potentially impacted VECs, in consultation with stakeholders ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 33-36).
* Step 2: Implement scoping activities to identify other activities (past, on-going or planned) within the specified analytical boundaries, and to find any external influences, both natural and social, and stressors to the condition of identified VECs (e.g., extreme climatic events like droughts or floods, or seasonal migration of transhumance pastoralists with grazing cattle) ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 36-39).
* Step 3: Investigate and define the current condition of the VECs and evaluate its potential reactions to stress, in order to establish a baseline status of the VECs ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 39-41).
* Step 4: Assess social and environmental impacts and risks, as well as the cumulative impacts on the VECs and the potential change in their condition; in this step, all synergistic, additive, countervailing and otherwise interacting effects should be identified ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 42-45).
* Step 5: Define appropriate thresholds and indicators for measuring changes to the condition of the VECs as a result of cumulative impacts and in the context of past, present and future actions; in this step, the significance of the predicted cumulative impacts will be determined, and all possible trade-offs identified ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 46-47).
* Step 6: Making use of the established mitigation hierarchy, design and implement (a) adequate strategies, plans and procedures to manage cumulative impacts to the VECs; (b) appropriate monitoring and mitigation programs; (c) engagement and collaboration with other relevant parties; and (d) effective supervision mechanisms ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), pp. 48-50).

As suggested above, IFC emphasizes identification of VECs in collaboration with affected communities (especially Indigenous Peoples communities) in order to ensure all project sustainability criteria are properly identified and evaluated. The IFC process also stresses a broad temporal and spatial perspective&mdash;meaning that a cumulative impact assessment needs to take into account past, present and future activities within a project’s area of influence. Finally, collaboration with host governments is emphasized as a necessary part of the process, especially with regard to data collection and analysis. 

For development practitioners in emerging markets, where the necessary data to support a robust CIA may not be available, the IFC proposes a process of 'Rapid Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management' (RCIA) ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), p. 7). An RCIA is a desk-based review and a condensed version of the CIA process described above, carried out by a single operator using available secondary data (such as ESIA baseline data and risk-identification frameworks, project planning documents, etc.). Over time, an RCIA may evolve into a more extensive CIA, especially where collaborations between multiple operators are fostered. The IFC *Good Practice Handbook* recommends that all private sector operators conduct at least an RCIA where resource inventories and plans do not exist and where government-led CIAs are untenable ([IFC 2013](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3aebf50041c11f8383ba8700caa2aa08/IFC_GoodPracticeHandbook_CumulativeImpactAssessment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), p. 9). It should be noted, however, that the Bank Information Center criticizes the IFC approach for affording borrowers too much discretion in structuring and implementing their CIAs, and for failing to require such assessments prior to approving investments ([Bank Information Center, 2013](http://www.bicusa.org/issues/safeguards/environmental-and-social-assessment/)).


## Concluding remarks

The challenge of assessing and managing cumulative impacts will grow in importance as awareness increases of the inter-connection between economic development and environmental and social well-being. The 'good practice' recommendations available to development practitioners are numerous (far more are available than those referenced here!), and they provide us with useful tools to at least begin understanding, identifying and addressing cumulative impacts. As noted, however, the tremendous variation in governmental capacity to facilitate cross-sectoral CIAs is one of the most difficult barriers to effective work in this field. CCCS encourages our clients and colleagues to learn from the experiences of leading nations, such as Canada and the United States, to developing CIA frameworks and to work with project partners and governments to improve and extend operational frameworks for cooperatively assessing cumulative impacts. We feel this is possible through ongoing dialogue on issues of incentives and accountability and to demonstrate how structured regulatory environment can positively benefit all project stakeholders. The challenges may be many, but so too are the opportunities for cross-sector collaborations and meaningful investment in social performance, sustainability, and benefits-sharing.
