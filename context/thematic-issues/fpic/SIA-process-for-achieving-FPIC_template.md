Objectives:

i) a determination of which communities are entitled to FPIC

ii) a framework to implement PS7-specific engagement (disclosure and consultation) approaches to achieve ‘free, prior and informed consent’ (FPIC); this will include contributing to the  ‘Pre-FID’ version of the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP) by  informing the PCDP design via further stakeholder analysis, nuanced engagement planning, and disclosure and consultation activities to identify culturally-appropriate forms of participatory engagement and decisions making--especially in the context of FPIC.

iii) a strategy for interacting with external stakeholders and the media to articulate how the Abadi Project is interacting with Indigenous Peoples (masyarakat adat), including the topic of FPIC

Toward demonstrating adequate planning and implementation of community consultation practices in line with IFC PS7 requirements, this document elaborates a process for securing ‘free prior and informed consent’ (FPIC) from affected communities and for maintaining FPIC throughout the project lifecycle. 


Discussion and deliberations under this component will account for the interests and requirements of various project stakeholders, including: 1) directly- and indirectly-affected local stakeholders, 2) government bodies, 3) public organizations and 4) review panels and compliance agents of financial agencies, as appropriate. The framework will synthesize these discussions and set out a PS7-compliant implementation strategy.

Elements of this process include: 

* Determining which communities (geographic and ethnic) are considered “indigenous” for project purposes and therefore subject to PS7 engagement standards
    - evaluating claims of stakeholders from Ambon1 and across MDB2 
* Identifying communities that are entitled to special forms of consultation and engagement
    - revising PCDP categories of “Priority Directly Affected Communities (PDAC),” “Directly Affected Communities (DAC),” and “Indirectly Affected Communities (IAC),” in light of these determinations
* Identifying which local communities will need to provide their FPIC; this process will include identifying which specific stakeholders at both the household and community levels have a right to FPIC, especially a right to “consent”
* Identifying appropriate interpretations of FPIC for the client project context:
    - preparing a strategy for engaging stakeholders directly about the meaning of “consent” 
    - identifying local (Tanimbar) interpretations of "free, prior, and informed consent" (FPIC) and gathering local perspectives on achieving FPIC in the client project context
    - devising “good faith negotiation” (GFN) approaches for working with community and civil society stakeholders (e.g., Indigenous Peoples Organizations such as AMAN) as well as with public interest groups
* Defining a strategy for FPIC-specific circumstances that provides for: 
    - how to establish a mutually-accepted "consent process" between the client and Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples, 
    - how to ensure that Indigenous People are provided sufficient time to realize 'meaningful participation' in decision-making processes, and
    - how to record evidence of agreement between the parties of the outcome of FPIC negotiations
* Where FPIC applies, providing instruction for compiling documented evidence of adequate community consultation
    - ensuring that FPIC processes is defined to verify (i) project design, (ii) implementation, and (iii) evaluation and monitoring by scheduling periodic re-evaluation and monitoring throughout the project life-cycle
* Consulting experts in the CCCS network and IFI specialists as well as  reviewing available literature for guidance
* Proposing a forward-going strategy to involve in project design and planning the leaders of Indigenous Peoples’ representative bodies and organizations, as well as members of the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples, and helping to articulate this participatory process within the context of the PCDP. 
    - proposing an approach for consulting AMAN and civil society on indigenous/ masyarakat adat issues; review 'Advisory Note'
* Ascertaining government preparedness to help the client project fulfill its obligations in the following areas: 
    - capacity to plan, implement, and document  process of ICP and engagement and FPIC where relevant
    - clarity of government-provided entitlements of affected Indigenous Peoples
    - measures for bridging any disparities between such entitlements and the requirements of PS7
    - arrangements for sharing of financial and implementation responsibilities between the government agency and/or the client project
* Proposing a forward-going strategy for collaboration with local government to share responsibilities for project planning, implementation, and monitoring consistent with the objectives of PS7. To the extent that government agencies reciprocate interest, determine how the client project can feasibly contribute to governance relevant to Indigenous Peoples issues.
