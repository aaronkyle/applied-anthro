The International Labour Organisation’s [Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries – 169/1989](http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312314) refers to the principle of free and informed consent <a href="#ref,C169">[1]</a>:

**Article 6**

<ol type ="1">
<li>In applying the provisions of this Convention, Governments shall: 
<ol type ="a">
<li>Consult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly; 
<li>Establish means by which these peoples can freely participate, to at least the same extent as other sectors of the population, at all levels of decision-making in elective institutions and administrative and other bodies responsible for policies and programmes which concern them; 
<li>Establish means for the full development of these peoples' own institutions and initiatives, and in appropriate cases provide the resources necessary for this purpose. </li>
</ol><li>The consultations carried out in application of this Convention shall be undertaken, in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances, with the objective of achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures. 
</li></ol>

**Article 16**

<ol type="1">
<li>Subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, the peoples concerned shall not be removed from the lands which they occupy. 
<li>Where the relocation of these peoples is considered necessary as an exceptional measure, such relocation shall take place only with their free and informed consent. Where their consent cannot be obtained, such relocation shall take place only following appropriate procedures established by national laws and regulations, including public inquiries where appropriate, which provide the opportunity for effective representation of the peoples concerned. 
<li>Whenever possible, these peoples shall have the right to return to their traditional lands, as soon as the grounds for relocation cease to exist. 
<li>When such return is not possible, as determined by agreement or, in the absence of such agreement, through appropriate procedures, these peoples shall be provided in all possible cases with lands of quality and legal status at least equal to that of the lands previously occupied by them, suitable to provide for their present needs and future development. Where the peoples concerned express a preference for compensation in money or in kind, they shall be so compensated under appropriate guarantees. 
<li>Persons thus relocated shall be fully compensated for any resulting loss or injury. 
</li></ol>

* <a href="http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (1992)

Among the few legally binding international human rights instruments, the Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 (‘CBD’) in article 8(J) requires contracting States, to “respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities ... and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovation and practices.”

<a id="EI_review1"></a><a id="Decision_V/16"></a>The Fifth Conference of Parties (‘COP’) to the CBD Decision V/16 expressed a firm commitment to the implementation of prior informed consent in its general principles: “access to traditional knowledge, innovation and practices of indigenous and local communities should be subject to prior informed consent or prior informed approval from the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices.” <a href="#ref,Decision_V/16">[2]</a> Decision V/16 further calls upon “parties to take measures to enhance and strengthen the capacity of  indigenous and local communities to be effectively involved in decision-making related to the use of their traditional knowledge, innovations and practices relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity subject to their prior informed approval and effective involvement.” <a href="#ref,EI_review1">[3]</a>

### Non-binding Instruments

* <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/vienna.aspx">Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action</a> (1993)

* <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,REFERENCE,UNSUBCOM,SESSIONALREPORT,,403f46ec4,0.html">Norms on the Responsibility of Transnational Corporations</a> (2003)

* <a id="UNDRIP"></a><a href="http://social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples/DeclarationontheRightsofIndigenousPeoples.aspx">Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People</a> (2007)

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People <a href="#ref,UNDRIP">[4]</a> explicitly recognizes the principle of FPIC in Articles 1, 11, 19, 28, 29 and 32. These Articles confirm the right of Indigenous Peoples to determine and develop priorities and strategies for the development or use of their lands, territories and other resources, including in connection with development and utilization of surface and subsurface resources. Specifically, FPIC is invoked in:

<ol type="a">
<li>Article 10 vis-à-vis forced relocation;
<li>Article 11 on rights over culture traditions and customs, including intangible and tangible heritage;
<li>Article 19 vis-à-vis legislative and administrative measures taken by the States;
<li>Article 28 with regards to rights over lands, territories and resources; and
<li>Article 29 on issues of environmental degradation an hazardous waste disposal; and
<li>Article 32 vis-à-vis development planning.
</li></ol>

<a id="Support_Group"></a>In terms of application within the UN system, the UNDP in 2004 conducted surveys among UN bodies, funds, programmes and specialized agencies in order to gather information about ‘how the principle of FPIC is understood and applied by the United Nations Programmes, Funds and agencies’ (E/C 19/2004/11). The report states that 10 out of 19 UN agencies implemented FPIC in their policies and practices and FPIC is embedded in the human rights framework. UNDP applies the principle in three areas: in the context of developmental planning and programming; on issues of resettlement; and on issues of indigenous knowledge.<a href="#ref,Support_Group">[5]</a>

### “Informed Consent” in Inter-American Human Rights Law

<a id="Dann_case"></a><a id="Dann_case,2"></a>
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has found that Inter-American human rights law requires “special measures to ensure recognition of the particular and collective interest that indigenous people have in the occupation and use of their traditional lands and resources and their right not to be deprived of this interest except with fully informed consent, under conditions of equality, and with fair compensation.”<a href="#ref,Dann_case">[6]</a> The IACHR stated that this right is part of a number of “general international legal principles applicable in the context of indigenous human rights.”<a href="#ref,Dann_case,2">[7]</a>

<a id="Maya_case"></a>More recently, the IACHR stated that <a href="#ref,Maya_case">[8]</a>:

<blockquote>“Articles XVIII and XXIII of the American Declaration specially oblige a member state to ensure that any determination of the extent to which indigenous claimants maintain interests in the lands to which they have traditionally held title and have occupied and used is based upon a process of fully informed consent on the part of the indigenous community as a whole. This requires, at a minimum, that all of the members of the community are fully and accurately informed of the nature and consequences of the process and provided with an effective opportunity to participate individually or as collectives. In the Commission’s view, these requirements are equally applicable to decisions by the State that will have an impact upon indigenous lands and their communities, such as the granting of concessions to exploit the natural resources of indigenous territories.”</blockquote>
