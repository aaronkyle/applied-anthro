Pro-active planning begins with project design and planning, when explicit consideration of the project’s potential physical and social footprint should lead to integrated projects that take into account a project’s potential social and economic impacts and local and regional development consequences. 

At the outset, the project should ask and answer the following questions:

* What are the opportunities to include social considerations in project design and planning?
* What trade-offs exist between project-defined optimal design and “socially optimal” design?
* How will the project benefit from proactive management of social considerations?

Project social development design and budget decisions are made throughout the project cycle and must change in response to the outcomes of formal environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) and resulting management plans. At the time of initial project planning, clients have the option to begin planning for its real or expected benefits in short- and long-term horizons.
