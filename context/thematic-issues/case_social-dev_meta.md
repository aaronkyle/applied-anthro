One among the first research topics assigned to me as [social development practitioner](/terms/social-development-practitioner/) was to write a 'business case for social development'. I was young (in my early twenties), new to my job and to the profession, and I had no idea where to start.

Clearly, I was given a loaded question, and one that I have been thinking about ever since.

I enjoy investigating questions a piece at a time. What is 'business case'?  What is 'social development'? More basically still, what is 'business' and what is 'development'?

Here's where I'm at.

### What is business?

Business, to me, is to process of making money and earning profit.  It's an invented, imaginary, and yet actualized concept.

The act of doing business has consequences.  Those running the business, it clients, suppliers and others directly involved, all seek to benefit from the business,  This is the act of profit-making.

Good business practices are those that help to guide businesses to make profits&mdash;or to avoid liabilities.

### What is a 'business case'?

A business case is an argument for undertaking some form of action or activity based around the notion that such is either profit-making or that it mitigates liability (such as may result in profit loss). 

### What is development?

[Development](/terms/development/) is an imagined concept of how the future can or ought to be shaped from the basis of existing context and human knowledge. A person's understanding of the concept of development is shaped and influenced culturally, experientially, and intellectually.

### What is social development?

[Social development](/terms/social-development/), in the context in which it was ask, refers to fields of knowledge and practice at the intersection of development interventions and human societies (which I recognize is a nearly boundless definition).
