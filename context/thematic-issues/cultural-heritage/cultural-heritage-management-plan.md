# Template Living Cultural Heritage Management Plan


---

## Introduction/Orientation

This section provides a high-level description of the project, including:

Description of logistical bases, and associated facilities and the extent to which the project is required to develop additional infrastructure, services, and utilities;
Project development schedule.

The introduction will also discuss the Project regulatory environment as it relates to Indigenous Peoples.


## Situation Analysis

A situation analysis helps to articulate social contexts as they are experienced (or are likely to be experienced) by different stakeholder groups.  As a management tool, a situation assessment aids in later assessment of the likelihood and severity of project-induced risks to local communities, and helps to gauge the potential impacts thereof. The Situation Assessment is arrived at from review and analysis of project literature, contextual insights, and interviews with key stakeholders. The field visit will also contribute primary-source inputs into this component.

Specific topics to be addressed in the situation analysis include:

### Regional and Socio-Economic Contexts1

Local and regional biophysical and socioeconomic contexts
Local and regional development / sectoral analyses (data permitting)
Capacity of local and regional government, infrastructure, services, and utilities

### A 'Cultural Snapshot' of the community in 2012

Anthropological perspectives on the phenomena of culture change
100 years of community cultural change: Trends and correlations
Trends in IP customs, beliefs, traditions, indigenous knowledge systems and practices (IKSP) 2
Changing attitudes towards and involvement with outsiders and in-migrants.
Environmental management practices3
forms of land use
A discussion of qualitative and quantitative data (field research findings)

### Cultural Heritage Desk Screening4

Potential sites for encountering tangible cultural heritage, including:
Likely sites of past human habitation
Likely sites of significant cultural activity
Known sacred lands
Types and significance of cultural heritage sites
Estimated likelihood for encountering tangible cultural heritage sites / resources
Recommendations on the need for a ‘Tangible Cultural Heritage Assessment’


## Cultural Impact Assessment

The cultural impact assessment will attempt a systematic description of the likely effects of the the project on ecological, economic, and social aspects of community culture given: 1) the nature and extent of the activities planned by the project, 2) the Project social impact area affected and 3) the number of ICCs/IPs affected.5.

Key Questions the Cultural Impact Assessment will respond to6:

* How is the project enabling IP assertion of their character and identity as peoples and respect the primacy of their cultural integrity?
* How is the project helping to ensure IP rights to manage own land and other resources within their ancestral domain?
* How is the project ensuring that ICCs/IPs’ concept and requisites of sustainable and responsible development and protection of ancestral domains shall benefit the present and future generations?

To help answer these questions, the impact assessment will also include desk-based reviews (via literature and interviews) of comparable project approaches to cultural heritage preservation for project-affected minority ethnic groups.

Recommendations to the client will be developed based on CIA-derived insights, with particular attention given to the Resettlement Action Plan.


## Action Plan for Cultural Heritage Management

Based on the findings of both the situation analysis and cultural impact assessment, consultancy will propose an action plan for cultural heritage management for the client project.  The action plan will include:

A. Mitigation Measures. Measures for avoiding negative Project impacts on the community members and their culture, such as may include a roster of proactive actions to bolster community language usage, strengthen safety measures for community women, and enhance community access to illness-preventing interventions. Discussion of mitigation measures will also address cultural sustainability after mine closure will also be proposed.

B. Measures to Enhance Opportunities (Social Benefits-sharing). Strategies for enabling IP-driven livelihood-improvement and project social benefits sharing including employment, training, and education. This section will address options for Project-support to the maintenance/preservation of community living heritage.

C. Community Based Natural Resource Management Component. Strategy for encouraging sustainable natural resource management among community communities.  Recommendations in this section will be based on an assessment of the ecosystems services provided by their natural environment.

D. Grievance Mechanism. A transparent and culturally accessible mechanism for handling grievances.

E. Monitoring, Evaluation & Reporting.


## Cultural Heritage Implementation Plan

Following an intensive disclosure of the CHAP to the community communities and key stakeholders, the Cultural Heritage Implementation Plan will be prepared. Incorporating stakeholder/community suggestions for [CHAP](#) finalization, the [CHIP](#) will detail costs, budget, timetable, and organizational responsibilities for all CHAP mitigation and opportunities enhancement measures. Potential implementing partners, such as the Tribal Foundations or other civil society organizations, may be involved at this stage.﻿
