# Cultural Heritage Screening Report – BRIEFING NOTES


## IFC definition of “cultural heritage”

Performance Standard 8 applies to tangible forms of cultural heritage having archaeological (prehistoric), paleontological, historical, cultural, artistic, and religious values, etc.—in including moveable or immovable objects, sites, structures, groups of structures, natural features, as well as landscapes and unique natural environmental features that embody cultural values, such as sacred groves.

The requirements of Performance Standard 8 apply to cultural heritage regardless of whether or not it has been legally protected or previously disturbed.


### IFC requirements for the protection of cultural heritage

IFC expects clients to protect and support cultural heritage by undertaking internationally recognized practices for field-based study and and documentation of cultural heritage sites and artefacts.

Where a project may affect cultural heritage, the client must consult with affected communities within the host country who use, or have used within living memory, the cultural heritage for longstanding cultural purposes to 1) identify cultural heritage of importance, and 2) incorporate the views of the affected communities into the client’s decision-making process on such cultural heritage.

IFC also requires consultations to involve the relevant national or local regulatory agencies that are entrusted with the protection of cultural heritage and will establish chance find procedures established through the Social and Environmental Assessment.


## Cultural Heritage sites identified in the CSAR

[CSA](# ) consultations with project-affected community members revealed that several sacred sites exist within the project area. As these sites (including landscapes) can be understood to possess cultural, spiritual and/or religious value, it is important that they be recognized by project-planners.


Also noted by the [CSAR](# ) (but not treated in much detail) is the accidental discovery of a potentially “active” cultural heritage site near base camp where human remains were identified. The use and significance of this site also needs to be established by the cultural heritage screening report.



## Cultural Heritage Screening Report – WORKING OUTLINE

The Cultural Heritage Screening Report should identify the extent and complexity of potential cultural heritage impacts in the project’s area of influence. If the screening indicates potential adverse impacts, further analysis will be necessary to ascertain the nature and scale of these impacts and proposed mitigation measures.

1. Determining the Potential for Cultural Heritage in the Project Area
1. Sites of Cultural Heritage
   * This section will review the different sites of cultural heritage sites and artefacts that are likely to be encountered in the project area, including:
        - Likely sites of past human habitation
        - Areas most likely to have been inhabited by human beings over the course of the Island's history (such as cave sites, protected reefs, estuaries, mountain fortification sites, etc). It is expected that the determination of past habitation sites will drive primarily from the application of archaeological methods for site identification—geographical analysis (i.e. analysis of island topography). Methodology for making determinations should be detailed.
   * Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
        - Map potential sites of past human habitation on the island and cross-reference against the proposed construction and mining sites
        - Likely sites of significant cultural activity
1. Sites estimated to be the location of past cultural activities, including battlefield sites, burial grounds, sites of religious ceremonies etc. Inputs for this section will come primarily from historical analyses and recommendations from local cultural authorities/experts.
   * Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
        - Conduct a literature review of past archaeological research in the Project area / region to help determine the likelihood for encountering significant archaeological remains
        - Conduct a literature desk study of historical records about the Project area / region to help determine the likelihood of encountering significant historical remains
1. Known sacred lands
   * Sites regarded by current Island inhabitants as having symbolic or religious value. Such sites may include reported graves of fabled ancestors or groves of sacred/culturally significant crops.
   * Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
        - Review TM03 Community Social Assessment (CSA) data on local cultural heritage for community inputs, and hold discussions, as necessary, with TM03 team experts involved in CSA site investigations

Types and Significance of Cultural Heritage Sites
Discussion of likely-encountered artefacts should also be included in this section.
The significance of cultural heritage sites is a determination made by local experts/cultural heritage authorities. Estimations of significance may derive from a variety of factors: potential value of a site to the archaeological community, such as sites of past human habitation that could help to sequence the arrival of different ethnic groups to the island/region; value the of the site to the local community, such as sites relating to community origin myths or oral histories; etc.
Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
task e)	Draft a summary discussion on the likely types of culture heritage to be encountered in the Project area and their relative significance for archaeological and historical research

Likelihood for Encountering Cultural Heritage Sites
The likelihood for encountering cultural heritage sites is a determination made by local experts/cultural heritage authorities. Estimations of likelihood, may derive from a variety of factors: the extent to which a specific areas are known to have witnessed events of cultural significance, such as from reputable accounts of known historical battles, mass graves, etc.; the degree to which an area corresponds to other sites of known significant cultural value, such as cave habitation sites, etc.
Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
task f)	Indicate likely sites of historical or archaeological interest in Central and East Halmahera Regencies, and the general potential for encountering such sites (unknown/low/moderate/high), and the methods used when making these determinations

Map of Potential Cultural Heritage Sites
A map of potential cultural heritage sites will be generated by local experts/cultural heritage authorities. The map will provide a visual depiction of likely areas of past human habitation and, to the extent and specificity possible, will indicate areas where other known and likely sites of heritage cultural heritage value are located.
Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
task d)	Map potential sites of past human habitation on the island and cross-reference against the proposed construction and mining sites

Determining the Need for a Cultural Heritage Assessment
The need for a Cultural Heritage Assessment will be determined by the consultant social team in close consultation with local and international cultural heritage experts and relevant Indonesian government authorities. To the extent possible, consultant team’s recommendations will also draw on civil society inputs. This determination will be made only after all inputs for the cultural heritage screening report have been taken into account.
Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
task g)	Consult with local experts (academic and civil society) about cultural preservation efforts in the area/region.


Towards a framework for Government Collaboration

Client must ensure compliance with national law as well as with internationally recognized practices1 for site surveys, excavation, preservation and publication. In most cases, Cultural Heritage Assessment studies will need to be formally permitted by the appropriate national heritage authority. Further, because national heritage law often lacks detailed implementing regulations, required heritage protection measures may need to be formulated as a project-specific agreement that is negotiated and signed by a project representative and the heritage authority.
Although the client has the prerogative to employ heritage specialists it finds most appropriate, it should be noted that both the investigations and the individuals performing such studies might require permitting by national heritage authorities
Contributing inputs from Desk Study Protocol:
task h)	Compile Indonesian government regulations and regulations on cultural heritage preservation
task i)	Suggest a framework for collaboration with the provincial-level cultural heritage authorities (e.g. Culture and Tourism Department, and the History and Traditional Values Preservation Office).
