WBN CULTURAL HERITAGE FIELD PROTOCOL / ToR


1 INTRODUCTION
This Field Protocol for preparation of the ERAMET/Weda Bay Nickel Cultural Heritage Screening Report. This Protocol provides a common understanding of the Terms of Reference (ToR) that guides a desk study of information necessary for determining the need for a complete Cultural Heritage Assessment (CHA). 
This field protocol is intended to resolve several key issues for making recommendations about the need for a Cultural Heritage Assessment: (i) assessing the likelihood of encountering sites of significant archaeological importance within the Project COW; (ii) identifying high-potential areas of past human habitation on the Island; and (iii) determining the likelihood that the project will trigger local and/or national policies for cultural heritage protection.
Specifically, this Field Protocol describes the following:

Work-plan (Schedule and timing)

1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The project area has not been subjected to a scoping exercise to determine the presence of cultural heritage sites. However, it is widely recognized that the vicinity was home to the two prominent Muslim kingdoms of Ternate and Tidore. It is therefore possible that undisclosed sites from the two kingdoms may exist in the COW. Furthermore, the Community Social Assessment (CSA) field investigations indicated the potential presence of a burial ground within the vicinity of Tanjung Ulie camp. As such, it is prudent for WBN to complete a screening of potential sites of past human occupation to determine the likelihood of encountering significant deposits of cultural artefacts prior to beginning construction of any proposed facilities. 
The cultural heritage screening shall collect and review reports of past archaeological surveys in and around the project area as well as across the region. It will consult with historical records to help augment assessment of the likelihood of encountering archeologically significant sites in the project area. The study will also consult national and local regulatory agencies dealing with cultural heritage issues and report on any necessary preservation actions that must be incorporated into WBN’s cultural heritage protection protocols. 

2 METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH
1.1 Archaeological Survey and Mapping
The first part of the study shall consist of a literature review to identify any past archaeological research conducted on Halmahera Island and across the region (i.e. Maluku and Sulawesi islands, as appropriate). This archaeological survey shall seek to answer the likelihood that an archaeological site of significance will be found within the proposed COW. Example indicators for significant impacts are: presence of a high density of artefacts or of archaeologically significant artefacts unearthed by previous studies within or near the project COW; presence of a high density of artefacts or of archaeologically significant artefacts unearthed on other islands with similar geographical features and human settlement profiles in the region; anecdotal evidence from nearby residents of the presence of a past settlement or significant sites in the project area.
The study will also map potential sites of past human habitation on the island.
1.2 Historical Survey
Past historical events can augment assessments of the likelihood of encountering artefacts of significance to local cultural groups. For this reason, the second part of the study will survey the historical record for indicators of important events in the project area that would suggest a higher potential for encountering historic archaeological remains. Interviews with key experts (or academics) or other notable historians shall also be conducted.  Special attention will be given to historical studies of the Sawai people.      
1.3 Policy Review
If the screening determines that more analysis is needed, then a Cultural Heritage Assessment (CHA) will need to be carried out in close collaboration with—and securing the permission of—local authorities. To prepare for this possibility, the third part of the study involves a review of national and international laws and regulations, as well as consultation with government, academic, and civil society experts. The purpose of these investigations is to determine whether project operations in general and a CHA specifically are likely to trigger local and/or national heritage preservation policy requirements.

3 WORK PLAN
1.4 Key Tasks
The key tasks necessary to complete this Cultural Heritage Screening are as follows:
a) Review TM03 Community Social Assessment data on local cultural heritage for community inputs
b) Conduct a literature desk study of past archaeological research in the project area / region to help determine the likelihood for encountering significant archaeological remains
c) Conduct a literature desk study of historical records about the project area / region to help determine the likelihood for encountering significant historical remains
d) Map potential sites of past human habitation on the island and cross-reference against the proposed construction and mining sites
e) Draft a summary discussion on the likely types of culture heritage to be encountered in the project area and their relative significance for archaeological and historical research
f) Indicate likely sites of historical or archaeological interest in Central and East Halmahera Regencies, and the general potential for encountering such sites (unknown/low/moderate/high), and the methods used when making these determinations
g) Consult with local experts (academic and civil society) about cultural preservation efforts in the area/region.
h) Compile Indonesian government regulations and regulations on cultural heritage preservation
i) Suggest a framework for collaboration with the provincial-level cultural heritage authorities (e.g. Culture and Tourism Department, and the History and Traditional Values Preservation Office).
j) Prepare the Cultural Heritage Screening Report , presenting a discussion of the outcomes of all desk study components along with maps, lists of likely sites of historical and archaeological significance, and a briefing paper on local, provincial and national policies for cultural heritage protection that might be applicable to the project and the framework for collaboration with provincial-level cultural heritage authorities
