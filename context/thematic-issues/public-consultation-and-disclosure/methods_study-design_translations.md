## A short note on translations

I developed the materials for a project in Indonesia, although being an English speaker, I have compiling questions primarily in in English.

Where I have original original submissions in Bahasa Indonesia, many of the questions corresponding to these submissions have been modified and re-worked in the integration process.Â  As a result, most of the translations are no longer 'accurate' to the English (source) materials.
