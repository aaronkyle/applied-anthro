Finally, a short note on translations:  CCCS' primary focus has been on compiling and integrating questions from our experts in English.  While we have been maintaining some of the original submissions in Bahasa Indonesia, many of these submissions have been modified and re-worked in the integration process.  As a result, most of the translations are no longer 'accurate' to the English (source) materials.  CCCS will be focusing on finalizing all translations ahead of printing.
