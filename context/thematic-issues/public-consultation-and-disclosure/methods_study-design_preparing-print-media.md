Preparing questions into a printed format for fieldwork.

To complete this work, our team first needs to specify which questions will be raised during semi-structured surveys and which will be raised during focus group discussions (FGDs) and then subsequently we will arrange these questions in a manner that can be easily completed by our field team. In this process, some questions will be arranged in tabular format; we attempt to indicate this in the spreadsheet using a light blue / light purple color.
