Relevant jurisprudence is named and summarized here. This list is not exhaustive, but included to identify a fair selection of applicable law. 

### Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO)

The Government of Indonesia is party to the eight (8) ‘fundamental’ ILO conventions, four (4) of which contain provisions relating to consultation, disclosure and/or grievance redress:

* C 29:Forced Labour [1930]
* C 111:	Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) [1958]
* C 138:	Minimum Age [1973]
* C 182:	Worst Forms of Child Labour [1999]

Pertinent details of these conventions are as follows:

#### C 29:	Forced Labour [1930]

Convention 29 contains the following provisions which outline requirements for community consultation, disclosure, and grievance redress:

* Article 2e states that communities, or their direct representatives, must be first consulted about the necessity of a particular community service before being compelled and obligated to perform that community service.
* Article 23 stipulates that any person from whom forced or compulsory labor is exacted must be allowed to forward to the authorities all complaints relative to labor conditions. Labor Regulations must be in place to ensure that such complaints are examined and taken into consideration.
* Article 24 mandates that any authorities, who are extracting forced or compulsory labor, must notify the laborers of all the regulations governing the lawful extraction of forced or compulsory labor. 

#### C 111:	Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) [1958]

Convention 111 contains the following provisions on community consultation, disclosure, and grievance redress:

* Article 3 requires state parties to seek both employer and worker cooperation in promoting the acceptance and observance of the convention’s anti-discrimination employment policy. It obligates states to “enact legislation and promote such educational programs as may be calculated to secure the acceptance and observance of the policy.”
* Article 5 specifies that measures designed for the special protection of vulnerable populations shall not be deemed as discrimination, and enables state parties to establish such measures in consultation with representative employers’ and workers’ organizations.

#### C 138:	Minimum Age [1973]

Convention 138 contains the following provisions for public consultation and disclosure:

* Article 2 (para. 4) stipulates that state parties whose economy and educational facilities are insufficiently developed may initially specify a minimum working age of 14 years only after consultation with the organizations of employers and workers concerned.
* Article 3 (paras. 1-3) requires regulating authorities to consult with concerned employer and worker organizations when determining types of employment likely to jeopardize the health, safety or morals of young persons. These types of employment require a minimum working age of 18 years for admission to any type of employment or work which by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or morals of young persons. 
* Article 5 requires state parties whose economy and administrative facilities are insufficiently developed to publically consult with concerned employer and worker organizations should they wish to initially limit the scope of application of this convention.
* Article 8 stipulates that only after consultation with the organizations of employers and workers concerned may a competent authority, by permits granted in individual cases, allow exceptions to the prohibition of employment or work outlined within this convention for such purposes as participation in artistic performances. 
* Article 9 (para. 3) requires state parties to enact national laws or regulations that require employers to keep and make available a register of all employees under 18 years of age that contains their names and ages.

#### C 182:	Worst Forms of Child Labour [1999]

Convention 182 contains the following provisions which outline requirements for community consultation:

Article 4 (paras. 1-3) requires state parties to consult with concerned organizations of employers when determining and reviewing types of work that by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children, taking into consideration relevant international standards and particularly paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation, 1999. 
Article 5 Each Member shall, after consultation with employers' and workers' organizations, establish or designate appropriate mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the provisions giving effect to this Convention. 
Article 6 (paras. 2) Requires that programs of action to eliminate as a priority the worst forms of child labor shall be designed and implemented in consultation with relevant government institutions and employers' and workers' organizations, taking into consideration the views of other concerned groups as appropriate. 

### Convention on Biological Diversity [^CBD]

The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international legally binding treaty.[^CBD-parties] The Convention has three (3) main goals:

1) conservation of biological diversity;
2) sustainable use of its components;
3) fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.

Within the convention, the following passages relate to community consultation and participation:

#### Article 8:In-situ Conservation

Article 8(j) specifies that, subject to national legislation, party states must:

“respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices”.

This article carries with it the implicit requirement that for projects affecting indigenous and local communities, such communities need to be consulted with and studied regarding their practices of biodiversity conservation. Indigenous participation is critical not only in regards to gathering this information, but also in terms of deciding equitable recompense for the benefits accrued from the utilization of indigenous knowledge.

#### Article 14:	Impact Assessment and Minimizing Adverse Impacts

Article 14(c) notes that parties to the convention must promote informed consultation on activities that are likely to cause significant adverse impacts on the biological diversity of other States, or areas beyond the limits of their own national jurisdiction. Such promotion may be achieved by encouraging the negotiation of bilateral, regional or multilateral arrangements. 

#### Decisions of the Conference of Parties

In addition to the CBD itself, the Decisions of the Conference of Parties (COP) must also be taken into account—intended as they are to determine the policy, strategy and program priorities within the framework of the COP. 

At the Fifth Conference of Parties, a Decision [^CBD-decision-v16] was adopted reiterating the necessity of the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the development of guidelines for benefits sharing. In addition, the Decision clearly states that women and women’s organization must be fully incorporated in the consultation process and given full access to participation. To achieve these aims, the Decision mandates that various mediums of communications should be used to most effectively reach, inform, and include the views and concerns of target indigenous populations. The Decision also states that Indigenous People should be engaged to develop a register of knowledge on traditional practices and lifestyles relevant to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and about ways to strengthen legislation, customary practices and traditional systems of resource management and methods of protecting their knowledge against unauthorized use. It requires that women’s knowledge be of conservation and methods of sustaining biological diversity be specially documented and preserved. Finally, the Decision of the Fifth Conference of Parties states that Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be consulted and encouraged to participate in the development of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding any development proposed to take place on sacred sites and on lands or waters occupied or used by indigenous and local communities. 

### Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination [^ICERD]

The United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) is a second-generation human rights instrument that commits its members to the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of understanding among all races. The Government of Indonesia acceded to this convention on 25 Jun 19995 (with the reservation that it does not consider itself bound by the provision of Article 22).

While the ICERD itself does not contain specific requirements on community consultation, it establishes the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination6, and empowers it to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly. This Committee’s guidelines do contain disclosure and consultation provisions.

#### Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination7

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four (4)-year terms, with half the members elected every two (2) years. The CERD holds regular thematic discussions on issues related to racial discrimination and the Convention. The Committee then publishes its interpretation of the content of human rights provisions, in the form of general comments (referred to as ‘general recommendations’ in the practice of this committee) on thematic issues.

All parties are required to submit regular reports to the CERD outlining the legislative, judicial, and executive policies and other measures they have taken to give effect to the Convention. The first report is due within a year of the Convention entering into effect for that state; thereafter reports are due every two (2) years or whenever the Committee requests. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of ‘concluding observations’.

Based on, and in response to, the initial three (3) reports8 submitted by the Government of Indonesia (2000, 2002, and 2004), the CERD in 20079 made recommendations to amend Indonesia’s domestic laws, as the new regulations were designed to integrate the economic and social interests of Indigenous Peoples into the country’s overall modernization, economic, and social development plan. The aim of such reform and integration is recognition and respect of the important contributions of Indigenous People’s cultures to national identity. Indigenous Peoples should also be provided with the means for sustainable economic and social development. Consultation and cooperation with Indigenous Peoples is deemed necessary to achieve these goals.

The Committee also prescribes certain measures to ensure the protection and recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ communal land. Before the commencement of land development projects, the possession and ownership rights of local communities should be secured. This process should be based on meaningful consultation and should ensure the participation and consent of Indigenous Peoples.

Finally, the Committee strongly recommends efforts to prevent the resurgence of ethnic conflicts. The Committee recommends assessments of the adverse impact of the transmigration program—particularly on the rights of local communities—and encourages initiatives to promote mutual understanding between communities and mutual knowledge and respect for their histories, traditions and languages.


## Voluntary International Social Policy ‘Good Practice’ Frameworks


Following the recommendations of the International Finance Corporation10 the Project is committed to achieving internationally-recognized “good practice” disclosure frameworks for sustainability reporting. Toward this end, the Project will issue periodic ‘Sustainability Briefings’ that report on project performance relative to key sustainability indicators, as culled from a variety of recognized international standards: the Equator Principles, the UN Global Compact, ISO 26000, the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 11 and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).12 

This section provides an overview of the provisions of key international standards for achieving sustainable social and environmental development. More detailed information about these frameworks is provided in Annex 3: ‘Voluntary Sustainability Frameworks’. 

### Equator Principles

The Equator Principles13 (EPs) are a voluntary set of standards for private sector banks to use when determining, assessing and managing social and environmental risk in project financing.14 The Equator Principles are modelled after the standards of the World Bank and the social policies of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). 

Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) commit only providing loans to projects where the borrower is able to comply with social and environmental policies and procedures underpinning the principles. The Principles apply globally and across all industry sectors. The Equator Principles apply to project financings covering expansion or upgrade of an existing facility where changes in scale or scope may create significant environmental and/or social impacts, or significantly change the nature or degree of an existing impact.

As of June 4, 2013, 79 financial institutions in 35 countries have adopted the Equator Principles.15 In June 2013, the Equator Principles were revised in a third iteration [Equator Principles III]—effective from June 4, 2013 and applied to all new transactions from January 1, 2014. 

### UN Global Compact

The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is a strategic policy initiative for businesses committing to aligning their activities with the ten (10) Global Compact Principles16 in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.17 

The Global Compact is a voluntary forum for discussion and a network for communication. The UNGC does not provide for any mechanisms to enforce or monitor compliance. Membership is contingent only on regular submissions of a Communication on Progress. 

### ISO 26000

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global federation of national standards bodies that develops voluntary ‘International Standards’ for efficient and effective industries.

ISO 26000 is an International Standard for ‘Social Responsibility’ approved in 2010. Addressing core subjects for social responsibility, ISO 26000 is not specific to any industry and can be applied by any entity aiming to understand and integrate social responsibility into its operations as part of a general sustainable development program. 

ISO 26000 defines the following seven (7) principles for social responsibility:

1) accountability;
2) transparency;
3) ethical behavior;
4) respect for stakeholder interests;
5) respect for the rule of law;
6) respect for international norms of behavior; 
7) respect for human rights.

### IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting

The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) is a global oil and gas industry association working for environmental and social issues, and its membership covers over half of the world’s oil production.18

The IPIECA Petroleum industry guidance for voluntary sustainability reporting [2003; 2010], published together with the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP), is a voluntary guidance document aimed to serve as a resource for interested companies. The guide frames a petroleum industry ‘consensus’ on the most prevalent sustainability issues when evaluating performance across the sector. Issues are framed using indicators for environmental, health and social performance. Five (5) general principles guide IPIECA sustainability reporting:19

1) relevance;
2) transparency;
3) consistency;
4) completeness;
5) accuracy.

The IPIECA Sustainability Guide also a step-by-step account of how to operationalize sustainability reporting—describing what to report, specifically what indicators are to be employed in data collection.20

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

The Global Reporting Initiative a non-profit organization that produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting, collectively known as the “GRI Sustainability Reporting Framework”.21 The framework includes specific guidelines (the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines) for focusing on four (4) key areas of sustainability performance: economic, environmental, governance, and social, with the ‘social’ category being sub-divided as: 1) labor practices and decent work, 2) human rights, 3) society and 4) product responsibility. The key principles of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (currently in their fourth iteration, and hence referred to as the ‘G4 Guidelines’) are summarized below. 22

#### G4 Principles for Defining Report Content

Stakeholder Inclusiveness

Participant organizations should identify stakeholders and explicate responses to their reasonable expectations and interests.

Sustainability Context

Reporting should present the organizational performance in the broader context of sustainability.

Materiality

Reporting should address organizations’ significant economic, environmental and social impacts and/ or aspects that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.

Completeness
 
Reporting should include coverage of material aspects and their boundaries, sufficient to reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, and organizations should enable stakeholders to assess the organization’s performance in the reporting period. 


#### G4 Principles for Defining Report Quality


Balance

Reporting should reflect positive and negative aspects of organizational performance to enable a reasoned assessment of overall performance.

Comparability

Organizations should select, compile and report information consistently. Reported information should be presented in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyze changes in organizational performance over time, and that could support analysis relative to other organizations.

Accuracy

Reported information should be sufficiently accurate and detailed for stakeholders to assess organizational performance.

Timeliness

Organizations should report on a regular schedule so that information is available in time for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Clarity

Organizations should make information available in a manner that is understandable and accessible to stakeholders.

Reliability
 
Organizations should gather, record, compile, analyze and disclose information and processes used in the preparation reporting documents in a way that they can be subject to examination and that establishes the quality and materiality of the information.

The G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines provides for different categories of information that participating organizations must disclose—defined both in terms of ‘General Standard Disclosures’ and ‘Specific Standard Disclosures’. The guidelines also distinguish between two tiers of compliance: ‘Core’ and ‘Comprehensive’, the latter tier requiting additional reporting elements, including information on the organization’s strategy for operational management, governance, as well as a statement of ethics.

### Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) 

The Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative is a global coalition of governments, companies and civil society working together to improve openness and to provide accountable management of revenues from natural resources. All of these groups are represented on the EITI Board which is supported by the EITI International Secretariat. Countries participate in the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative by applying to the international EITI Board. 23

The application process for joining the EITI includes announcing the government’s commitment to achieving the ‘EITI Standard’24, developing a work plan to achieve EITI compliance, and working with companies and civil society to achieve compliance targets. Specific requirements include25:

1. effective oversight by a multi-stakeholder group [government, companies and civil society]
2. production and timely publication of comprehensive EITI Reports, including:
     - contextual information about the extractive industries
     - full disclosure of extractive industry revenues
     - disclosure of all material payments to government by oil, gas and mining companies
3. a credible assurance process applying international standards
4. active promotions of EITI Reports
5. review the outcomes and impact of EITI implementation and action on ‘lessons learned’

Indonesia has been an EITI ‘Candidate Country’26 since 19 October 2010 and remains in the process of completing all requirements for attaining the status of a ‘Compliant Country’.27
