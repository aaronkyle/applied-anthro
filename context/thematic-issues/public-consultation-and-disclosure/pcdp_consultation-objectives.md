## Consultation Objectives

### Information Exchange

Relative to project-affected communities, consultation activities focus on effective systems for information exchange to ensure that the local communities are kept informed of Project-related activities in their area in a timely manner. Where aspects of Project design and implementation may have a potential positive or negative impact, community members shall be afforded opportunities to voice their concerns and opinions, and WBN shall take these community inputs into consideration when planning appropriate risk mitigation and compensatory measures. Community delegations shall be invited to participate in the planning and implementation of Project benefits programmes in order to ensure community buy-in for planned initiatives. 

### Partnering with the Government

Relative to government relations,consultation activities seek to engage government partners at all levels—from national ministries to local level counterpartst to village leaders—into a collaborative dialog to address mutual problems, challenges, and opportunities.

### Participating in Decision-making

Consultation with the wider public go beyond simple information sharing to ensure that the public have a say in decisions about actions that could affect their lives. Such public participation includes the promise that the public’s contributions will have a direct influence on such decisions. Principles [^iap2-list] for such participation by WBN include the understandings that public participation: 

* promotes sustainable decisions by recognising and communicating the needs and interests of all participants, including decision-makers
* seeks out and facilitates the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision
* seeks input from participants in designing how they participate
* provides participants with the information they need to participate in a meaningful way
* communicates to participants how their input affected the decision
