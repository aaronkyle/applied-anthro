## National Law

### Presidential Decree (Keppres) No. 26 of 1989 re:  Ratification of the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage

SUMMARY

The law ratifies the UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage from November 23, 1972, in its entirety. The Convention was established in recognition of the growing threat of destruction faced by cultural and natural heritage sites, and places certain demands on State Parties for consultation and disclosure in relation to the protection of cultural and natural heritage sites.

CONSULTATION

The UNESCO Convention does not contain a large amount of requirements for public consultation. Instead, it calls for State Parties to promote knowledge and appreciation of natural and cultural heritage among their populations. While the Convention does not contain any direct requirements levied on any entities outside of State Parties, the requirements listed here could be of relevance for entities engaging with State Parties in areas where natural and cultural heritage is concerned or located.

Article 5 (a) and (e): In order to ensure that effective and active measures are taken to protect, conserve and present cultural and natural heritage, the Convention requires state parties, to the extent possible, to adopt a general policy that provides a function for the cultural and natural heritage in the life of the community. The protection of identified heritage will be integrated into comprehensive planning programs, and the protection, conservation and presentation of cultural and natural heritage is to be fostered through training at national or regional training centers that also encourage scientific research in the field.

Article 8 and 10: The Convention also establishes an Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage of Outstanding Universal Value (the Committee). The election of its members shall ensure equitable representation of the different regions and cultures in the world.  This Committee may at any time invite public or private organizations or individuals for consultation on particular issues related to cultural and natural heritage.

Article 21 states that before granting international assistance to State Parties, the Committee shall carry out studies and consultations that it deems necessary for a decision to be made.

Article 27 requires each State Party to strengthen the appreciation and respect by their peoples of identified cultural and natural heritage by all appropriate means, particularly through educational programs. 

DISCLOSURE

While the Convention does not contain any specific requirements for public disclosure, it does require State Parties to keep up-to-date and publish lists of all identified natural and cultural heritage.

Article 11 requires each State Party to the Convention to compile an inventory of its natural and cultural heritage, on the basis of which the Committee will compile, publish and keep up to date a World Heritage List. Inclusion of property on this list requires the consent of concerned State Parties, and the list is to be updated and distributed every two years. When necessary, the Committee will also compile and keep up to date a list of endangered world heritage, which will include the costs of operations required to safeguard the threatened heritage.

Article 13 states that the Committee shall publish and keep up to date a list of property for which international assistance for State Parties has been granted.

Article 27 requires State Parties to keep their publics informed of the threats faced by its cultural and natural heritage.

### Regulation of the Minister of the Interior No. 32 of 2010 re: Guidelines for Granting Building Permits

### Regulation of the Minister of Forestry of Republic of Indonesia No. P.18/Menhut-II/2011 Ttg: Guidelines for Borrow and Use of Forest Area




### Regulation of the Minister of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia No. 4/Menhut-ll/2011 re: Forest Reclamation Guidelines

SUMMARY

The law stipulates guidelines for forest reclamation, with a view to make possible the implementation of Article 51 number 6 Government Regulation Number 76/2008, which concerns forest reclamation in natural disaster areas.  The guidelines are meant to promote holistic mining activities, and stipulate that the basic principles of reclamation as presented in the guidelines be implemented as soon as possible, and not simply when the mining activities are finished. The guidelines provide reference points for actors engaged in forest reclamation in areas formerly used for forest utilization, and contain a number of requirements for public consultation and disclosure. The law contains several technical requirements on how forest reclamation licenses are to be issued and how forest reclamation is to be carried out, managed, evaluated and ended.

CONSULTATION

The requirements for consultation primarily concern the collection of data ahead of, during, and upon the end of forest reclamation activities. Some requirements also overlap with the requirements for disclosure, primarily in terms of assessment and evaluation of forest reclamation activities. Consultation is mainly required with and via various governing bodies, depending on whether the activities take place on a central or a regional level. 

Articles 5 and 6 require actors to include primary and secondary data on the economic social condition of residents of the area, as well as from villages that may be affected by mining activities, in compiling the location inventory for the concerned forest area, which is to be used as baseline data for utilization. Factors accounted for will include demography, income levels and livelihood details, education level, community institutions, land ownership and community cultures. Article 22 further stipulates that analysis of the area’s biophysical and socio-economic condition shall form the basis of the technical design of the annual reclamation plan for every location.

Article 30 requires the implementation of forest reclamation to comprise both civil and vegetation techniques adjusted to the local conditions.

Article 51 includes a recommendation to prevent illegal grazing through the education and provision of livestock feed seed of the local population. While not a specific requirement for consultation, the provision promotes an educational outreach that implies interaction with the local population.

Articles 56-57 require the license holder to establish and continuously improve a Human Resources institution, which is to possess expertise in the field of forestry, agriculture, mining, soil, and other fields relating to forest reclamation. The provisions do not directly name public consultation as a requirement in relation to this institution, but consultation could be one of the responsibilities of this institution.

DISCLOSURE

Like the requirements for consultation, those applying to disclosure primarily concern the evaluation and assessment of forest reclamation activities and their implementation. Several technical requirements are detailed, such as what data will be contained in various reports and via what instance this data is to be reported and disclosed, depending on the level that activities take place.

Article 9 requires the results of analysis and evaluation of numeric and special data to be mapped on a reclamation plan, on a scale no smaller than 1:25,000, as a basis for a 5-year or annual reclamation plan. 

Article 15 (2) requires as part of the preparation of the forest area the relocation and clearing of infrastructure no longer in use, as well as the installation of signs, prohibition and closing of the entrance to mine location.

Article 25 [sic! There are two Article 25. This refers to the second instance in the document] requires the minister/management of government or non-government institution to develop an information system and ensure the communication of national space layout suited to the requirements of the region. 

Article 26 [sic! There are two Article 26. This refers to the first instance in the document] stipulates that the arranged 5-year reclamation plans are to be analyzed by “the Minister of Technical, Governor, or Regent/Major accordingly to their authority by involving Minister”. These plans are to include information on the policy, plan and program for the stipulated space layout and information on the direction of space utilization.

Articles 27-28 [sic! There are two Articles 27 and 28. This refers to the second instances in the document] stipulates that the assessment of 5-year and annual forest reclamation plans shall be carried out by the Director General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry on behalf of the Minister. The Director General also gives recommendation should the necessary requirements be assessed as fulfilled, and the Minister of Technical, Governor or Regent/Mayor (according to their authority) is responsible for ratifying the assessed plans.

Article 55 requires the license holder to have a special organization to handle the forest reclamation, whose duties shall include establishing the maintenance, research, monitoring and reporting of all execution plans and efforts of forest reclamation.

Article 59 requires technical monitoring and assistance on forest reclamation implementation to be performed at least once a year, carried out on both the central and the regional level. 

Article 68 specifies the usage of the result of technical monitoring and assistance as to check the development/progress of reclamation implementation and ensure compliance with the law. These results will be reported by the technical instance handling forestry affairs at the District/City level to the Governor cq. Head of Provincial Forestry Office, with a copy to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry; by the technical instance handling forestry affairs at the Provincial level to the Governor eq. Head of Provincial Forestry Office, with a copy to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry; and the results of technical monitoring and assistance by the Management Office of RFA will be reported directly to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry.

Article 69 requires assessment of the success of forest reclamation to be done every 5 years or a year before expiration of the license, to be carried out by a team coordinated by the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry. At the regional level, a team coordinated by the Provincial Technical Office that handles forestry carries it out. This provision may be relevant in terms of tracking documents that may be required to be publicly accessible.

Articles 72-3 require the system of control and observation on forest reclamation implementation to be measurable, reportable, and verifiable, and the results to be transparent and open for review. The implementation of this system of control must also be based on sufficient mapping/spatial data; the availability of database system of process documentation and activities output; and the availability of a monitoring results system. All data and information resulting from forest reclamation monitoring and observation are to be presented in numeric/textual, spatial, and visual forms. 

Articles 74-75 require the implementation of observation with an MRV system to meet the following stages: a) Output observation/monitoring; b) Outcome observation/monitoring; c) Impact observation monitoring; and d) Benefit observation/monitoring. The license holder will also prepare satellite images with sufficient resolution of the forest area before the utilization takes place. 

Article 76 requires the license holder to submit periodical reports of forest reclamation implementation to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry, with copies to the Directorate General for Forest Planology [sic] of Ministry of Forestry; Directorate General of Mineral, Coal, and Geothermal, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources; the Provincial Technical Office that handles forestry; and the District/City Technical Office that handles forestry.

Articles 77-78 stipulate that the Forest Reclamation Report will consist of a Quarterly Report and an Annual Report, which aside from data on report format will contain SPAS data, photos of reclamation activities implementation, and a map with coordinates of reclamation acreage (scale 1:10,000). The license holder must also provide condition pictures/images of forest area borrow-use acreage from “the 0 year” up to the transfer/return of it.

The EIS Document will contain an Introduction containing (1) a summary of the business and/or activity plan, with a focus on activity components that could potentially result in environmental impacts; (2) a description of hypothetical important impacts with reference to the scoping results in the TOR Document; and (3) a description of the borders of the studied area and the time limit of the study, based on the scoping results in the TOR Document and accompanied by maps or spatial information data. In the event that the term of TOR assessment as specified in Article 23 of the Government Regulation No. 27/2012 on Environmental License has exceeded and EIA Assessing Committee has not issued the decree of TOR approval, an Agreement Approval Letter of Term of Reference or Statement of Term of Reference Document Administration Completeness shall be enclosed. 

The EIS Document shall contain a detailed description of the initial environmental setting, which will encompass:

Environmental components exposed by the important impacts of the business and/or activity plan, as well as the environmental condition, which will at least contain geo-physical-chemical components, biological components, socio-economic and cultural components, and community health components.
The business and/or activity around the proposed location, along with the resulting impacts on the environment. 

Detail data and information related to environmental setting may be delivered in enclosure. Where there are alternative locations, detailed descriptions of all alternatives will be provided. Also, the description of the initial environmental setting shall use data from time series. In this section, the composer of EIA document shall also describe the qualitative and quantitative conditions of various natural resources in studied area of the business and/or activity plan which has been or will be utilized or is still in form of potential. The condition of natural resources is important to present in map and/or label in adequate scale and if necessary completed with diagrams, figures, graphs or photographs as necessary.

The document shall also contain a description of the Important Impact Estimation. This section will contain a detailed description of every identified potential impact, including the degree and the characteristics of each identified impact. The composer of the EIA Document is recommended to take the following into account:

Impact estimation shall be carried out meticulously regarding the degree of important impact from the perspective of bio/geophysical-chemical, social, economical, cultural, spatial, and community health aspects during pre-construction, construction, operation, post-operation of in accordance with the type of its business and/or activity. 
Analysis of the difference in quality condition between the environment estimated with business and/or activity and that without business activity within the given time limit and using impact estimation method.
In conducting the study, it is necessary to take into account direct and/or indirect impact. Direct impact is defined as impact directly resulted from business and/or activity; indirect impact occurs as the result of change in certain environment component and/or primary business or activity due to presence of business and/or activity plan. In connection with this, it is necessary to consider the mechanism of impact flow in various environmental components, among others:
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural and community health components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on geophysical-chemical-biological components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural, and community health components, a series of further impact consecutively on geophysical-chemical and biological components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural, and community health components, a series of further impact consecutively on biological, social, economical, cultural and community health components;
important impacts take place in chain among social, economical, cultural and community health components as well as geophysical-chemical and biological components;
important impacts in items a through e which have previously been discussed result in adverse impact on business and/or activity plan.

Should the business and/or activity plan be in a stage of selection of component alternatives (such as location, equipment usage etc), a study will be carried out for each identified alternative.
A summary of the theoretical basis used in evaluation, as well as assumptions adopted, procedures, results of calculations, may be enclosed as supporting evidence.

The document shall also contain a Holistic Evaluation on Environmental Impact. In this section, the EIA document composer shall describe the results of evaluation/study of the interconnection and interaction of every identified hypothetical important impact. The impact evaluation method used shall be the same as the one set forth in the TOR Document. If the EIS study provides several component alternatives of the business and/or activity plan, this section shall contain a detailed recommendation of the best possible option, and a description of the basis of the recommendation. The results of the study of interconnection may generate the following information:

The form of interconnection and interaction relationship of DPH along with the characteristics among others frequency of impact, duration and intensity of impact.
The components of business and/or activity plan most likely to result in environmental impact.
Area of concerns along with coverage (local, regional, national, or even international of cross-borders), for example areas exposed by various impacts that are occupied by groups of society, and/or areas exposed to environmental impacts that are susceptible or disaster-prone.

Based on the results of the study described above, the composer of the EIA document shall conduct a study of various options of environmental impact management to be conducted, for all components that will likely result in environmental impact. These results may in turn be used as directions for the basis of composing the RKL-RPL Document in greater operational detail. Based on all of the aforementioned results, the EIA initiator/composer may conclude or provide a statement of environmental feasibility of the studied business and/or activity plan, using the following feasibility criteria:

The spatial plan under the prevailing governing laws.
Policy in environmental protection and management as well as natural resources as set forth in governing laws.
Security and defense.

The holistic evaluation results of the entire hypothetic important impacts as an interconnected and interacted unit.
The ability of initiator and/or related party responsible for dealing with the negative important impacts that potentially emerge as a result of the planned business and/or activity, by applying technological, social and institutional approaches.
The business and/or activity plan is prevented from obstructing social values and people’s view.
The business and/or activity plan shall not effect and/or hamper ecological entity that:
is a key entity and/or species;
has important ecological value;
has important economic value; and/or
has important scientific value.
The business and/or activity plan shall not result in any constraint on business and/or activity previously existing around the planned location of business and/or activity.
The business and/or activity plan may not exceed environmental supportability and capacity of the planned location.

SUMMARY

The law ratifies the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from October 17, 2003, which is appended in its entirety. The requirements for public consultation and disclosure fall mainly on the relevant government entities. The opening articles of the law also declare that the Government of Indonesia will not be bound by Article 26 (1) of the Convention, which obliges ratifying governments to pay into an Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund. This provision is granted by Article 26 (2) of the Convention. 

Article 2 defines intangible cultural heritage as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills  - as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith - that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history; and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.” This intangible cultural heritage is manifested, among other things, in oral traditions and expressions (including language as a vehicle of intangible cultural heritage); performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; and traditional craftsmanship.

CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

### Government Regulation (PP) No. 60 of 2012 re: Amendment to Government Regulation No. 10 of 2010 on Procedure of Altering the Appropriation and Function of Forest Areas



### Government Regulation (PP) No. 10 of 2010 re: Procedure of Altering the Appropriation and Function of Forest Areas

SUMMARY

The law makes requirements to the procedure of altering the appropriation and functions of various forest areas, all of which are defined in the first article. The change of either the appropriation or the function(s) of forest areas require taking the socio-economic condition of the communities in or near the forest areas into account. Notably, the law does not contain any requirements for public disclosure.

CONSULTATION

While the law does not contain explicit requirements for public consultation, there are several requirements for which some level of consultation seems assumed to be necessary. For example, changes in appropriation or function(s) of forest areas are required to take the socio-economic condition of communities into account, and these changes must also be made with the public’s aspirations in mind.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Protected Forest is “a forest area whose main function is to protect a life-supporting system to regulate water sources, prevent floods, control erosion, avoid seawater intrusion, and maintain land fertility.”
Production Forest is “a forest area whose main function is to produce forest products.”
Permanent Production Forest is “a forest area with the class of slope, type of soil, and rainfall intensity which, after each of the factors is multiplied by a weighing factor, scores below 125, exclusive of protected forest, wildlife reserve, natural conservation and hunting ground.”
Limited Production Forest is “a forest area with the class of slope, type of soil, and rainfall intensity which, after each of the factors is multiplied by a weighing factor, scores 125-174, exclusive of protected forest, wildlife reserve, natural conservation forest and hunting ground.”
Convertible Production Forest is “a forest area which by space is reserved for development other than forestry activities.”
“Change that has a significant impact, wide scope and strategic value is a change that has an impact on biophysical conditions such as climate change, ecosystem, and water sources, as well as socio-economic impact on the present and future generations.”
 
Article 2 requires changes in the appropriation and function of forest areas to meet the demand of national development dynamics and public aspirations. This will be done by continuous optimization of distribution functions, by using forest areas in a sustainable and conservable way, and through proportional maintenance of forest areas. 

Article 41 states that a change in function within the main function of conservation forests includes changes in, among other things, “hunting ground into nature reserve, wildlife reserve, national park, grand forest park or nature tourist park.” Such changes can only be made if:
a) there has been a change in the biophysical condition of forest areas as a result of natural phenomenon, environmental impact or human activity;
b) an improvement period is needed to optimize the function and utility of forest areas; or
c) the scope of areas is very small and surrounded by the socio-economic environment as a result of development outside forestry activity that does not support the continuation of ecological process naturally.

Article 48 defines a change in the appropriation of forest areas that has a significant impact, wide scope and strategic value as a change in the appropriation of forest areas that has an impact on the biophysical condition of the forest or the socio-economic condition of the community. Impacts on the socio-economic condition of the community, in turn, is a change leading to a decrease or increase in the socio-economic condition of the community for present and future generations. This change can be either influential or not influential, and is based on guidance and criteria provided for in the regulation of the Minister. While not explicitly stated, understanding any potential change to the socio-economic condition of the community will likely involve some levels of public consultation to be accurate.

### Government Regulation (PP) No. 24 of 2010 re: Forest Area Utilization

SUMMARY

The law sets out requirements in connection with the usage of forest areas. All forest areas concerned are defined in the first article of the law. It limits the usage of forest areas for non-forestry development activities to activities with inevitable strategic aims, such as mining and religious activities.

CONSULTATION

The law does not contain any explicit provision requiring public consultation. There are, however, some restrictions and requirements to forest area usage that could require public consultation.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:
Production forest is “a forest area whose main function is to produce forest products”.
Protected forest is “a forest area whose main function is to protect a life-supporting system to regulate water sources, prevent floods, control erosion, avoid seawater intrusion, and maintain land fertility”.
The use of forest area is “the use of part of forest areas for non-forestry development activities without altering the function and appropriation of the forest areas.”

Articles 2 and 3 state that the use of forest areas is aimed at “controlling the use of part of forest areas for non-forestry development activities.” This applies only to production and/or protected forest areas, and this use shall be done without altering the main function of the forest area by observing borders, periods and environmental conservation. Some of the non-forestry development activities may include public consultation to determine.

Article 4 states that the use of forest areas for non-forestry development activities is limited to activities with inevitable strategic aims. These activities include:
religious activities, including places of worship, funeral places, and spiritual tourism;
mining;
power plants, transmission, and power distribution, as well as new and renewable energy technology;
telecommunication networks, radio broadcast station, and television relay station;
public roads, toll roads and railway tracks;
transportation facilities other than public transportation facilities for the transport of products;
water resource facilities and infrastructures, water installation networks, and clean water and/or waste water channels;
public facilities;
forestry-related industry;
defense and security;
public safety-supporting infrastructure; or
temporary shelters of natural disaster victims.

Article 6 states that the use of forest areas requires forest area lend use permits. One form of such a permit is compensation in the form of land (for provinces where forest area covers less than 30% of river basin areas, islands, and/or provinces. This compensation must be of a ration of at least 1 to 1 for non-commercial purposes, and at least 1 to 2 for commercial purposes.

Article 11 defines the handing over and reforestation of forest areas if compensation is in the form of land as one of the client obligations for being granted a permit in principle for the use of forest areas, with a maximum time period of 2 years (with the possibility of extension based on evaluation). 

Article 17 prohibits the holders of forest area lend use permits from transferring permits to other parties without Minister approval, and from using lend use forest areas as collateral to other parties.

### Government Regulation (PP) No. 45 of 2004 re: Forest Protection

SUMMARY

The law is aimed at enhancing the legal provisions from previous legislation on forest protection as a part of forestry. It contains provisions for the protection of forest areas from human impacts, livestock and natural disasters, which require consultation with public communities. 

CONSULTATION

The direct requirements for public consultation are exclusively directed towards communities living in or in proximity with the concerned forest areas. Consultation is aimed towards preventing and mitigating damage to the forest areas, and requirements are aimed at both government entities and permit holders.

Article 9 states that the execution of forest protection for areas delegated to customary law communities will be the responsibility of those communities. This forest protection will follow the traditional norms of the community, under the pertinent customary law.

Article 10 for “rights forests”, the execution of forest protection is the responsibility of the rights holder. These activities include, among other things, cooperating with the owner of forest concession rights, forest area management, forest exploitation permit holders, collection permit holder and the public communities.

Article 11 states that the central, provincial and regency/city governments shall provide facilitation, guidance and supervision towards the forest protection activities as defined in Articles 8 to 10.

Article 15 states that to protect forest areas from livestock disturbance, an area of the production forest may be specified or closed for livestock shepherding by the head of the forest management unit, with further provisions to be regulated based on a Ministerial Decree.

Article 16 states that efforts to protect forest areas from natural disasters in the form of volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, storms, droughts, and earthquakes, must involve cooperation with the related institutions as well as counseling the community to improve awareness.

Article 23 requires national, provincial and regency/city governments to include community counseling and partnership standards in efforts to prevent forest fires, and exercise guidance and supervision.

### Government Regulation (PP) No. 06 of 2007 re: Forest Management and Forest Management Planning, and Forest Utilization

SUMMARY

The law aims at securing sustainable forestry management for the improvement of people’s welfare, specifying what organizations will carry out forestry utilization and management, and the planning thereof. The exploitation of conservation forests, protected forests and production forests must be preceded by forest management plans, both in the short and long terms, and the law provides for the issuance of licenses for these forest types, as well as the obligations of the licensees. It also specifies the sanctions to be imposed upon permit-holders that violate specific provisions of the law. 

CONSULTATION

The law contains a large number of requirements for public consultation, both direct and indirect. Most of them have to do with the manner in which forestry management is carried out, requirements to be fulfilled for the granting licenses, as well as sanctions for violation of the requirement. Article 26 is of great significance for public consultation, as it prohibits the collection of non-timber forest products in protected forests by anyone other than the local community.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Forest Management Totality (KPH) is a forest management area, in accordance with the basic function and designation, which can be managed in an efficient and sustainable manner.
Forest Arrangement is an activity geared at designing a forest management unit, which covers activities of forest resource classification in accordance with the types of ecosystems and potentials contained therein. These activities have the goal of obtaining the maximal benefit for the people, in a sustainable manner.
Forest Exploitation is an activity of utilizing the forest area, including environmental services, timber and non-timber forest products, optimally and fairly in a sustainable manner for the benefit of the people’s welfare.
Area Exploitation is an activity of utilizing growth space to obtain optimal environmental, social and economic benefits, without impairing the main function.
License to Exploit Forest is a license issued by the authorized official, comprising the following licenses:
Business License to Utilize Area (IUPK), granted to utilize areas in protected and/or production forests.
Business License to Utilize Environmental Service (IUPJL), granted to utilize environmental services in protected and/or production forests.
Business License to Utilize Timber Forest Products (IUPHHK) and/or Business License to Utilize Non-Timber Forest Products (IUPHHBK), granted to utilize forest products in the form of timber and/or non-timber inside natural forests in production forests, through harvesting/felling, enrichment, preservation and marketing.
IUPHHK of Ecosystem Restoration Inside Natural Forest, granted for the preservation of the function and representation of production forests with important ecosystems.
IUPHHK/IUPHHBK inside timber estate, issued to utilize timber/non-timber forest products in production forest.
License to Collect Timber Forest Products (IPHHK), issued to take timber forest products in production forests.
License to Collect Non-Timber Forest Products (IPHHK), issued to take non-timber forest products in protected and/or production forests.
Industrial Timber Estate (HTI) is a timber estate in production forest, made up of groups of forest industry.
Smallholder Timber Estate (HTR) is a timber estate in production forest, made up of groups of communities.
Concession Forest is a forest located on land charged with a land title.
Communal Forest is a state forest, the main utilization of which is directed to empower communities.
Rural Forest is a forest that has not yet been charged with a license or right, which is managed by a village and utilized for the welfare of that village.

Article 11 stipulates that the forest arrangement for every KPH is executed in the whole forest area concerned. The government can also stipulate certain locations inside the forest as communal, traditional or rural forest, or forest area with special purpose (KGHDTK). Areas thus specified are inseparable from sustainable forest management principles.

Article 13 stipulates that the forest management plans formulated by the heads of KPH will pay due attention to the aspirations and cultural values of the local communities. Long-term forest management plans must contain strategies aimed at optimizing the functions of forest resources through activities such as community empowerment. Short-term forest management plans must contain a description of the participation of parties, which includes representatives of communities benefitting and/or impacted by the management of KPH.

Article 17, 18 and 19 state that forest exploitation is to be aimed at obtaining optimal benefits of forest products and services in a sustainable manner for the welfare of the people. This applies to conservation forests (excluding wildlife reserves, jungle zones and core zones in national parks), protected forests and production forests, and all such exploitation requires the appropriate license.

Article 23 states that forest exploitation in protected forests can be executed through the utilization of areas or environmental services, of through the collection of non-timber forest products (except inside “protecting blocks”). All these activities are to be aimed at enhancing the welfare of the communities, particularly local communities, through the improvement of communal awareness in preserving and enhancing the functions of protected forests.

Article 24 states that utilizations as meant in Article 23 may not result in negative impacts on the socio-economic condition of the community.

Article 26 requires that only communities around the forests execute the collection of non-timber forest products in protected forests. This collection is also executed only on condition that they have been available naturally, that the activity does not damage the environment, and that the main function is not reduced, changed or eliminated as a result of the activity. The collection may not be in quantities exceeding sustainable productivity or be of products protected by the law.

Article 32 states that the utilization of areas in production forests may not bring any negative impact to the socio-economic condition of the community.

Article 45 grants the collection of timber forest products inside natural forest in production forests to meet the need for building public facilities for local community groups and to grant the needs of Indonesians, so long as the collected timber product is not traded and does not exceed 50 and 20 cubic meters, respectively. These quotas are adjusted according to the need for public facilities and housing. 

Article 46 states that the collection of non-timber forest products inside natural forest in production forests is aimed at fulfilling the needs of local communities, and the products may be traded. 

Article 47 states that the collection of non-timber forest products inside timber estates in production forests is aimed at fulfilling the needs of local communities, and the products may be traded. 

Article 50 states that the validity period of the IUPJL in production forests, in the case of the utilization of water current service, is limited to 25 years, with the maximum value of 20 percent of the available debit of surface water, provided this does not reduce the public’s right to access the water.

Article 71 [letter a] requires all holders of business licenses to exploit forest areas to formulate action plans for the whole working area, in accordance with the validity period of the license and on the basis of the forest management plan prepared by the KPH. This action plan will contain, among other things, a description of the socio-economic condition of communities in the forest areas.

Article 72 requires holders of IUPJL, IUPHHK and IUPHHBK to cooperate with local community cooperatives, no later than one year after receiving the license. This cooperation can be in the form of participating interest or business cooperation in the segment of forest product exploitation. 

Article 73 requires holders of IUPHHK to formulate long-term business plans for the exploitation of timber forest products (RKUPHHK) [paragraph 1 letter a] as well as an annual action plan (RKT) [paragraph 1 letter b] no later than one year after the license has been issued. While not explicitly stated, it is likely that these plans are to include the socio-economic condition of the community as meant in Article 71. This requirement also applied to holders of IUPHHK of ecosystem restoration inside natural forests in production forests. [paragraph 5 letters a-c]

Article 75 applies the same requirements as Article 73 on holders of IUPHHK in HTI inside timber estates [paragraph 1 letters a-b]. Furthermore, these licensees are obliged to provide a maximum of 5 percent of the total area as live planting space for partnership with local communities. [paragraph 1 letter i]

Article 76 requires holders of IUPHHBK to formulate long-term business plans for the exploitation of non-timber forest products (RKUPHHBK) [letter a] as well as an annual action plan (RKT) [letter b] no later than one year after the license has been issued. 

Articles 79 and 80 stipulate that part of the forest-exploitation contribution and fund shall be composed of Provision of Forest Resources (PSDH), imposed on holders of the licenses IUPK, IUPJL, IUPHHK and/or IUPHHBK inside natural forest and/or timber estate, or IPHHK and/or IPHHBK, as well as a Reforestation Fund (DR) imposed on holders of IUPHHK inside natural forests. However, the collection of PSDH and DR does not apply to forest products from traditional forests that are utilized by traditional communities and not traded; timber forest products directly used by local communities and not traded; or timber forest products from concession or communal forests. 

Articles 83 and 84 require the empowerment of the local community through the development of its capacity and provision of access in enhancing its welfare. This requirement is the obligation of the government, provincial governments and regional/municipal governments, and the implementation thereof is the responsibility of the heads of KPH. The local community empowerment can be realized through rural forest, social forest or partnership. 

Articles 87 and 88 stipulate that local community empowerment through rural forest will be executed by granting exploitation rights to rural institutions in protected and production forests. The government, provincial governments or regional/municipal governments must also, according to their scope, facilitate institutional and business development as well as education, training and access to the market.

Articles 92 to 97 stipulate that local community empowerment through social forest, in conservation, protected or production forests, is executed through the issuance of a business license, in the form of IUPHHK to groups of communities in the form of cooperatives, to exploit social forests. The Minister, based on requests from local communities and recommendations from regents/mayors, stipulates the working area, and the government, provincial governments or regional/municipal governments must also, according to their scope, facilitate institutional and business development as well as education, training and access to the market. Such a license cannot be transferred or be used as collateral. 

Article 99 stipulates that community empowerment through partnerships is possible where the forest area has been provided either with a license for forest exploitation or a forest exploitation right for state-owned enterprises in the forestry sector. Partnership is defined as the cooperation between local communities and forest exploitation licensees on the basis of an agreement, and the minister, governors or regents/mayors are obligated to facilitate the establishment of such partnerships, including helping to settle conflicts. This partnership does not change the authority of the license or rights holders to exploit forests.

Article 104 states the creation of employment opportunities as one of the goals of forest-product primary industry, defined as downstream forest-product industries as meant in Law No. 41/1999 on Forestry, including both timber and non-timber industries.

Article 107 states that industrial business licenses and licenses to expand timber and non-timber forest product primary industry can only be granted to Indonesian individuals, cooperatives, private companies (BUMS Indonesia), state-owned companies (BUMN) and regional administration-owned companies (BUMD). Indonesian individuals and cooperatives are furthermore the only entities eligible for business licenses in the timber sewing industry (with a production capacity of up to 2,000 cubic meters per year) as well as industrial registry number for non-timber forest-product primary industry of timber estate. Any non-Indonesian business venture into this industry could thus require consultation with entities permitted to hold such licenses. 

Article 109 states that holders of business license for timber forest product primary industry can cooperate with holders of concession forests to meet their needs to raw material. This means that industrial license holders can collect timber from land or plantations belonging to communities.

Article 129 states that administrative sanction in the form of suspension of administrative service will be imposed upon holders of IUPHHK in HTI or HTR inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 75 paragraph 1 letters a or i. 

Article 130 states that administrative sanction in the form of suspension of activity in the field will be imposed on holders of IUPK or IUPJL or forest and on holders of IUPHHK inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provision of Article 71 letter a. 

Article 131 defines the administrative sanctions of Articles 129 and 130 as being imposed for one year. The sanction can be revoked at any time if the licensee fulfills the obligations within that year, and if the licensee fails to do so within the year, the license will be revoked after receiving three written warnings, in a period of 30 days for each warning. 

Article 132 states that the administrative sanction in the form of a fine up to 10 times the basic price of wood will be imposed on holders of IUPHHK in HTI or HTR inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provision of Article 75 paragraph 1 letter c. 

Article 133 states that the administrative sanction in the form of revocation of license will be imposed on: 
holders of IUPHHK inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 73 paragraph 1 letter a or b;
holders of IUPHHK of ecosystem restoration inside natural forest in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 73 paragraph 5 letters a or b;
holders of IUPHHK in HTI inside timber estate in production forest if they violate the provisions of Article 75 paragraph 1 letter a or b; and
holders of IUPHHBK if they violate the provision of Article 76 letter a or b.  

Article 134 states that the license holders identified above will be given three written warnings in a period of 30 days for each warning before their licenses are revoked, in order to allow them to meet their obligations.

### Government Regulation (PP) No. 27 of 1999 re: Environmental Impact Assessment

SUMMARY

The law aims at preserving the main functions of the environment in utilizing natural resources to improve the welfare of the people. This is done through requirements associated with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required of every business and/or activity plan likely to have significant environmental impacts. It defines the conservation of the environment as being the interest of the entire community, which in turn necessitates the participation of the community in the process of analyzing impacts likely to affect it. This law concerns the requirements associated with who is required to perform an EIA and in what manner, and not the content of said EIA.

CONSULTATION

The requirements for public consultation all emerge from the stated principle of public participation in the analysis of environmental impacts. Hence, the law’s requirements for public consultation concern the definition of this participation and the form in which it will be carried out. 

Article 3 states that what is defined as a major and significant impact on the environment includes activities that could affect artificial, social and cultural environments. Pending a decision of the Minister, these activities could be required to perform an EIA. 

Article 5 lists the following criteria for a particular business and/or activity plan’s major and significant impacts:

The number of human beings that will be exposed to the impacts.
The extent of the area affected.
The intensity and duration of the impacts from the time of occurrence.
The number of other environmental components affected by the impacts.
The cumulative nature of the impacts.
The reversibility/irreversibility of the impacts.

Accurately determining these criteria will require some level of public consultation. The article also states that the criteria may be adapted in accordance with scientific and technological developments.

Articles 9 and 10 include representatives of the affected communities as necessary parts of the central and regional commissions of assessment of the EIA. On the regional level, the representatives of the community are expected to be able to provide inputs about the aspirations of the affected communities.

Articles 19 to 21 stipulates that the central or regional commission of assessment will assess the EIA and plans for environmental management and monitoring, after which the responsible government agency will issue a decision on the environmental worthiness of the proposed business/activity. This decision is required to take the suggestions, opinions and responses of community members into account. The decision will be issued no later that 75 working days after the receipt of the documents, failing which the worthiness will be assumed by default. In those 75 days, consultation with community members on the received plans will take place. Should the documents be deemed incomplete, the responsible government agency will return analyses and documents with plans for improvement to the initiator. [Cf. Article 34]

Article 31 stipulates that EIA for businesses/activities undertaken by the economically weak will be assisted by the government, for example in the form of funding to cover the associated costs. This could entail public consultation if a business partner in the form of an economically weak community or cooperative is required to perform an EIA.

Article 33 states that community members are to be allowed to submit their suggestions, opinions and responses regarding the implementation of the business/activity within three days of the public announcement of the business and/or activity plan. These will be submitted in writing to the responsible government agency, and all suggestions and opinions must be reflected in the framework of reference and studied in the analysis of environmental impacts.

Article 34 requires the participation and involvement of concerned community members in the process of drawing up and evaluating the framework of reference, of the analysis of environmental impacts, and of the plans for environmental management and monitoring. The head of a government agency assigned to control environmental impacts will stipulate the form and procedure of this involvement. 

Article 37 stipulates that the costs associated with the drawing up and assessment of the framework of reference, the EIA and the plan for environmental monitoring will be borne by the initiating party. As these activities require the participation of the community, this implies that any costs associated with this consultation will be borne by the initiator. 
 

DISCLOSURE

While the law contains only two requirements for public disclosure that are intimately connected to the requirements for public consultation, they are quite important for compliance with the law. The principle of both, as well as of the law as a whole, is that the public shall be informed of any and all impacts that might affect it.

Article 33 requires all businesses/activities to be announced to the community before the EIA is conducted. The announcement will be made by the responsible government agency in the form of, for example, print and/or electronic media, and by the initiator in the form of, for example, a notice board at the place of operations. The announcement will at least contain the expected results of the business/activity, the types and volumes of waste expected and the method by which it will be managed, and the likely environmental impacts. 

Article 35 requires all documents of environmental impact analysis, community suggestions, opinions and responses, conclusions from the commissions of assessment, and the decisions of environmental worthiness of the proposed business and/or activities to be transparent and available to the public. These documents must also be handed over by the responsible government agencies to a documentation and/or archive institution.

### Government Regulation (PP) 16_2004 re: Land Use Management

SUMMARY

This regulation stipulates policies on land use management and the implementation thereof. The requirements are in relation to the regional spatial layout plan, and concern the ownership of land and its role in the use and utilization of land. 

CONSULTATION

The requirements for public consultation mainly concern cases where land is communally owned, as well as the requirement for public participation in the analysis of environmental impacts, specified in other laws. 

Article 1 contains the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Land use management is the control, use and utilization of land through institutional control, related to the use of land as a unit of systems to serve the public interest.
Control of land comprises the legal relations between an individual, a group of individuals or a corporate body and land, set for in Law No. 5/1960 on the Basic Regulation of Agrarian Principles.
Utilization of land is the act of obtaining added value without altering the physical form of the land used.
Land title is the title specified in Law No.5/1960 on the Basic Regulation of Agrarian Principles.
Regional spatial layout plan is the result of spatial layout planning, based on the administrative aspect and/or specified functional aspects.

Article 2 names compatibility, harmony and balance as some of the principles upon which land use management shall be based. This means that land use management must be aimed at harmonize the rights and obligations of each holder of land title, in order to reduce conflicts of interests among land users.

Article 3 names as one of the aims of land use management the ensuring of legal certainty to control and utilize land among the public that has legal relations with the land in accordance with the specified regional spatial layout plan.

Article 6 states that the policy on land use management applies to:

Plots of land equipped with land titles (registered or unregistered).
State land.
Communal reserved land owned by the customary community in accordance with law in force.

Article 14 states that holders of land titles, when using and utilizing land, shall abide by the requirements set forth in the prevailing laws. This includes the requirements for environmental impact analysis, which, as stipulated in other laws, requires community participation.

Article 15 states that the use and utilization of land on islets and plots of land bordering on coasts, lakes, dams and/or rivers shall observe the public interests and the supporting capacity, sustainable development, ecosystem linkage, biodiversity and environmental conservation. The reason for this is the uniqueness of such lands from the standpoint of social and economic activities, and identifying the related public interests could require consultation with the concerned communities.

Article 17 states that the utilization of land may be increased so long as it does not alter the use of the land and is in accordance with land titles and public interests.

Article 19 states that usage of space above and beneath the land not in connection to the control of land may be allowed if it does not disturb the use and utilization of the land, provided that approval of the holder of the land title is secured and it is carried out in accordance with the prevailing laws. 

Article 23 states that the adjustment of the control, use and utilization of land to the regional spatial layout plan will take the following into account:

The policy on land use management.
The rights of land owners.
Investments in the development of facilities and infrastructures.
The evaluation of land.
This adjustment will also involve public participation in accordance with prevailing laws.

DISCLOSURE

The majority of requirements for public disclosure stems from Article 2 of the law, which requires transparency in the implementation of land use management. The requirements identify what information needs to be collected and disseminated.

Article 2 names transparency as one of the principles upon which land use management shall be based, in the sense that land use management must be made known to all layers of the community.

Article 14 states that holders of land titles, when using and utilizing land, shall abide by the requirements set forth in the prevailing laws. This includes the requirements for environmental impact analysis, which, as stipulated in other laws, requires disclosure to the public.

Article 22 states that the implementation of land use management will include:

Inventorying the control, use and utilization of land.
Observing the balance between supply and demand in the control, use and utilization of land according to the spatial function.
Establishing a pattern to adjust the control, use and utilization of land to the regional spatial layout plan.

The results of this shall be presented in a map of larger scale than that of the map for the regional spatial layout plan. Considering Article 2, this could imply a requirement for public disclosure of this inventorying.

Article 23 states that the inventorying referred to in Article 22 will include:

Collecting and processing data on the control, use and utilization of land, the capacity of land, the evaluation of land, and supporting data.
Presenting data in the form of map and information on the control, use and utilization of land, the capacity of land, the evaluation of land, and supporting data.
Providing data in the form of a map as well as information on the control, use and utilization of land, the capacity of land, the evaluation of land, and supporting data.

The balance between supply and demand will include:

A revised balance sheet on the use and utilization of land in the regional spatial layout plan.
An adjusted balance sheet on the use and utilization of land in the regional spatial layout plan.
A presentation of established priorities in the provision of land in the regional spatial layout plan, which shall include a picture of opportunities and obstacles in the implementation of development by the government and the community.

Finally, the adjustment of the control, use and utilization of land to the regional spatial layout plan shall be carried out through:

Rearrangement, which includes land consolidation, relocation, swap and city rejuvenation.
Partnership, meaning the effort to achieve common goals with the rights and obligations jointly stipulated by the partnering entities.
Delivery and release of land titles to the State or other parties through compensation in accordance with the prevailing laws.

### Decree of the Chairperson of the Environmental Impact Management Agency, KEP 299/11 of 1996 re: Technical Guidelines on Social Aspects Assessment in Preparing Environmental Impact Analyses

SUMMARY

Establishes technical guidelines on the assessment of social aspects in preparing Environmental Impact Analyses (EIA). The guidelines are stipulated in Appendices 1-5 of this law, with specific guidelines for the preparation of 1) Environmental Impact Analyses; 2) Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact Analyses (KA-ANDAL); 3) Environmental Impact Analyses (ANDAL); 4) Environmental Management Plan (RKL); and 5) Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL).

CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

Article 1 defines the social aspect of the EIA as an investigation into demographic, economic and cultural components, which are inseparable from the other EIA components.

Appendix 1 B states the purpose of the Technical Guidelines as:

(1) To understand and enable assessments of social aspects in preparing Environmental Impact Analyses.
(2) To understand the relationship between bio-geophysical and social aspects Environmental Impact Analyses.
(3) To assist in making the process of preparing social aspects in the EIA easier.

Appendix 1 C states that the social component consists of (1) Demography; (2) Economy; and (3) Cultural aspects. The assessment of these will be performed in the preparation of the Terms of Reference of the EIA, the Environmental Management Plan and the Environmental Monitoring Plan. 

Appendix 2.1 states that the process of identifying potential social impacts in the components Demography, Economy and Culture may employ methods such as (a) a test list; (b) a simple interaction matrix; (c) field observations; (d) content analyses; and (e) group interaction. This identification should preferably be supported by analogous methods.

Appendix 2.2.1 states that the evaluation of potential impacts to social aspects to select and define components thereof relevant to be studied may include determining whether the planned effort/activity will cause any basic changes to (a) the population structure and process; (b) the pattern of ownership and natural resource control of inhabitants and households; and (c) the norms and value patterns, social institutions, social cohesion, economic activities and natural resources property rights of inhabitants.

Appendix 2.2.2 states that the selection of significant impacts to focus on should take into account (1) the impact on an environmental component that will undergo significant changes and vice versa; (2) social aspect impacts that will likely cause significant impacts on physical chemistry/biological aspects and vice versa; and (3) the causal relation between the significant social aspect impacts themselves.

Appendix 2.3.1 states that in defining project borders, the party must identify any public communities with social structures or socio-cultural values that could potentially be changed as a result of pre-constructional activities, construction and operation of planned efforts/activities. The party must also identify any pre-historical remnants or other items of religious importance for local inhabitants. Social structures are defined as:

(1) local public economic structures (agriculture, plantation, fisheries, services etc.);
(2) companionship structure;
(3) control of natural resources structure in the formal sense as well as according to local indigenous rights (hak ulayat); and
(4) social interactions which develop between the local public.

Appendix 2.3.2 requires the identification of what social structures (defined in Appendix 2.3.1) and sociocultural values may be impacted or changed due to the destruction of natural resources and environmental pollution caused by the planned efforts/activities through water, air and soil. This will be done after defining the ecological borders.

Appendix 2.3.3 states that the definition of social borders must take into account the public community identification results inside the project and ecological borders, as well as identification results outside these borders of communities potentially affected by the effort/activities.

Appendix 3 states that the preparation of the social aspect of the Environmental Impact Analyses must include descriptions of: 

a) the social data collection and method of analysis, as well as the impact forecasting and evaluation method;
b) planned efforts or activities;
c) the environmental state;
d) significant impact forecasts; and
e) evaluation of significant impacts.

In preparing these descriptions, a certain level of public consultation will likely be necessary. 

Appendix 3.A requires the consideration of the following issues in the description of data collection and analyses method as well as forecasting and impact evaluation method:
a) The scope of the study area will be as stipulated in the Terms of Reference (KA).
b) The examined Environmental Component is derived from the main social aspect issue defined in the KA.
c) The studied social environment component should be of specific locational nature, meaning that all social aspects components defined in the law KEPMENLH Number 14 of 1994 do not necessarily have to be studied.
d) In view of c, social aspect components may be added to the KA of the EIA, provided that a relationship exists between its physical-chemistry, biological and social aspects.

Appendix 3.A.1.1 states that as significant social impacts of a planned activity will not generally be spread evenly across societal groups and levels, the choice of a relevant data collection and evaluation method (both quantitative and qualitative) must take into account:

a) basic or significant social change experienced by a public group or social level to be studied;
b) units of analysis (household, village/desa, district/kabupaten, province) to be measured;
c) other measures deemed significant to the public surrounding location of the planned activity; and
d) availability of work form, time and budget. [Original meaning uncertain, but it seems that availability of these components to the concerned public is intended.]

Appendix 3.A.1.2 lists as possible data collection methods (a) field observation/surveillance; (b) secondary data collection; (c) interviews using questionnaires; (d) in-depth interviews with public figures or people with understanding of the local society’s condition; and (e) focus-group discussions performed with small homogenous groups (5-7 persons) to collect their opinions, views and aspirations.

Appendix 3.B requires the description of planned efforts/activities to contain data and information on (1) Policy and method of land procurements; (2) Intake of workforce, particularly from the local public; and (3) A development plan for public and social facilities.  

Appendix 3.C states that the environmental status should represent the condition of the social environment of the study area, particularly the social aspects identified in the Terms of Reference as being significantly impacted by the planned efforts/activities. The presented data on social aspects should be limited to relevant issues and closely related to the estimation and evaluation of impacts.

Appendix 3.D requires a systematic description of each environmental component that is expected to experience a significant impact, as follows:
a) Explaining the cause of the impact, such as impacts on the earnings of the public around the planned effort/activity as a follow-up impact of the change in work and working opportunities, or public perceptions towards the effort/activity.
b) Describe the estimation of impact magnitude by analyzing the difference in environmental quality with and without planned activities, and discuss whether the change caused by the impact is in a positive or negative manner.
c) Describe significant characteristics of the magnitude of social impact from the point of view of the public, the government or relevant experts.
d) Describe sub-components or parameters that are affected by further impacts arising from the identified significant social impacts.

Appendix 3.E requires the systematic evaluation of significant impacts, which will include a holistic discussion or study of the significant environmental implications (physic-chemistry, biological and social) as well as significant impact evaluations for each identified alternative for location or technology. The impact evaluation will also consider monetary values to establish a picture of the external costs and/or financial gains for the society or developing party.

Appendix 4 states that in formulating the Environmental Management Plan (RKL) for social aspects in the Environmental Impact Analyses (AMDAL) the following issues must be considered:
1) All the efforts undertaken to prevent, control and overcome any arising significant social impacts, as well as identifying which group or level of the society likely to be impacted, in which location and when, as well as what party will perform the environmental management.
2) Environmental management can be performed by governmental institutions and the affected/concerned public, provided that there is an agreement with the developing party and that the authority to handle/manage certain significant impacts is outside the jurisdiction of the developing party.
3) Efforts to manage social environmental aspects are performed through the prevention, control and handling of the significant impact sources.
4) The forms of public participation in preventing, handling and controlling impacts can consist of forming an environmental communication forum to handle arising environmental issues, with members from the developing party, the local society affected by the impacts, local government officials, as well as related institutions. Existing social institutions of the society should be utilized in overcoming arising environmental issues.
5) Compensation for the affected public, which is a form of environmental management, should consider mutual advantage.

Appendix 5 states that in formulating the Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL), and specifically in designing the monitoring of social aspects, the developing party should utilize information about the environmental quality obtained from the impacted society. The inclusion of such data should be accompanied by descriptions of the sample taking techniques applied, the number of samples taken and the location from where samples were taken. The environmental monitoring may also be performed by government institutions or the concerned public, provided there is an agreement with the developing party for such monitoring.

### Law (UU) No. 11 of 2010 re: Cultural Heritage

SUMMARY

Law № 11, 2010, recognizes that sustainability of cultural national heritage is important for understanding history, science and culture, and is central to national identity. The Law covers discovery, ownership, protection, maintenance, utilization and control of national heritage, including cultural heritage artefacts, buildings, structures, sites, as well as land and underwater areas of heritage value. 

Compared its 1992 processor, Law № 11, 2010, introduces slight modifications of the terminology and definitions associated with the notion of “cultural heritage” in line with changing international standards.  The concept of cultural heritage under the new law explicitly includes not only heritage objects and artefacts, but also buildings, structures and sites of heritage value—both as encountered on land and under water.  In addition to recognizing that both man-made objects and natural objects can have heritage value, Law No. 11, 2010, extends recognition to the heritage value of landscapes. Law No. 11, 2010, further extends the definitional scope of the concept of “valuable” cultural heritage to include those artefacts that of significance to Indonesian history, science, education, religion and/ or cultural practices. 

Protection of cultural heritage resources under Law No. 11, 2010, applies not only to data recovery, but rather interprets protection in a broader sense of contributing to the development and utilization of cultural heritage as a means of protecting and preserving heritage resources. Additionally, discovery of suspected objects of cultural heritage value must also be reported to a competent authority. Exploration for the purposes of discovering cultural artefacts remains contingent upon government permission and must taking into account the rights of ownership and/ control of any resources discovered. Preservation efforts must involve feasibility studies that give consideration to avoiding damage of sensitive areas and must be supported by documentation.  Protection may be accomplished through proper zoning. Monitoring of cultural heritage preservation plans is understood as critical.

Each person has the right to take advantage of the benefits of cultural heritage for the sake of religion, social, education, science, technology, culture and tourism. It is required that any person in possession of cultural heritage objects must register them with the relevant government authorities; any cultural materials not registered may be confiscated by the government. At the time of listing/ registration, the cultural value of the heritage object will be assessed. While primary control and ownership in heritage resources remains under the ultimate authority of the Indonesian state, the hereditary rights of indigenous people to use, control, and own artefacts of cultural heritage value is recognized—so long as the social functions of such do not conflict with legally-defined limitations.

Criminal provisions can be imposed on any of the following actions:

•Transfer of ownership of cultural heritage
•	Failure to report the discovery of cultural heritage
•	Non-sanctioned exploration with the intention of discovering cultural heritage
•	Intentional efforts to prevent, hinder, or frustrate cultural heritage preservation efforts
•	Intentionally damaging cultural heritage
•	Stealing cultural heritage
•	Moving / relocating cultural heritage resources without special permission separating cultural heritage resources from their original contexts
•	Taking cultural heritage out of its country of origin without a license
•	Altering the functioning of a heritage site or landscape 
•	Illicit reproduction of cultural heritage artefacts 

Criminal acts committed by a legal entity, including incorporated and/ or business entities, shall be prosecuted, including by prosecuting the party who gave the order to commit criminal acts.

Specific legislations concerning the implementation of Law No. 11, 2010, have not yet been issued, and all past legislations concerning implementation of Law No. 5 of 1992 (provided in Section 1.1.2.) will remain in effect as long as it does not prescribe or condone actions contrary to the provisions of Law No. 11, 2010. 

CONSULTATION

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant for public consultation:


Article 2 states the principles of the Conservation of Cultural Preserve as:
The values of Pancasila
Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, meaning consideration for diversity of people, religions, ethnics, and communities, regional special conditions, and cultures in social life of the nation and the state.
Archipelagic, meaning that every attempt for the Conservation of Cultural Preserve must always be for the sake of all regions of Indonesia.
Justice, meaning the representation of justice and equity in a proportional manner for all the people of Indonesia.
Orderliness and legal certainty, meaning that every management of Conservation of Cultural Preserve must be able to maintain public order through legal assurance.
Expediency, meaning the utilization of the Conservation of Cultural Preserve for people’s prosperity in terms of religion, education, science, technology, culture and tourism.
Sustainability

Article 18 requires the involvement of communities and stakeholders in the execution of KLHS. The involvement of communities shall be through dialogue, discussion and public consultation.

Articles 22 and 23 require every business and/or activity having substantial impact on the environment to have an AMDAL. One of the criteria to form the basis of the substantial impact is the size of the population likely to be affected by the business and/or activity plan. Among the criteria for a business and/or activity having substantial impacts is a process and activity potentially influencing the natural, artificial and socio-cultural environment.

### Law (UU) No. 20 of 2003 re:  National Education System

FOREWORD

The Government of Indonesia made political commitments at the World Education Forum (April 2000), along with other Governments and organizations, for achieving basic education for all. In this broader context, national level reflections were engaged for developing a new vision of education, as part of the reform in Indonesia, which emphasize the implementation of the principles of democracy, autonomy, decentralization, and public accountability. The reforms in education system have given prominence to enhance its performance in the framework of even distribution of educational opportunities. This reform process has fundamental impact on national education system and its mission to meet various challenges in the present day world.

Guided by the mission of education and educational strategies, the Republic of Indonesia enacted a new Law on National Education System in July 2003, resulting from national wide consultation. The Law has its foundations in the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia, Article 31, Section (1), of which states that each and every citizen shall have the fundamental right to education. The Law creates a legal framework for the major educational goal, policies and plans. The key targets include the expansion and equity, the improvement of quality and relevance, and the implementation of autonomy in higher education. The Law seeks to open access to education at all levels and all forms - formal, non-formal, as well as informal - for all the citizens of Indonesia. Its main thrust is to make education relevant to societal needs; to develop further community-based education; and to enhance participation by community in supporting basic education. It provides rights and obligations of citizens, parents, community, and Government. 

An outstanding feature of the Law is the implementation of compulsory basic education, free of cost, for all Indonesian citizens. Henceforth, “Every seven to fifteen years old citizen shall have the right to receive basic education”, as the Law provides. This is a major step towards creating a critical mass in the area of education for national development, as recognized in the National Plan of Action: Indonesia’s Education For All (2002). Its realization has become a primary responsibility for all education providers. This indeed deserves to be highlighted. In adopting the new legislation, the Government of Indonesia has been fully conscious of the need for creating equality of opportunity in education and to ensure that basic education is made available to all, including those belonging to economically disadvantaged or socially marginalized groups, and those living in remote areas. To that end, the Law reflects certain fundamental principles, notably universal access to basic education without gender bias, non-discrimination, equality of opportunity, and equity in education. National experience shows that the expansion of equity and equality of educational opportunities has not gone hand in hand with the quality improvement. The Law aims at making a good quality education available to all. Its basic purpose is to develop a national educational system to achieve the Education for All goals, to create opportunities for lifelong learning, etc. in today’s knowledge society.

The Law sets forth aims and functions of education, and national standards and the principles of the education system. It applies to all educational institutions that exist or may be created in the Republic of Indonesia. Its underlying philosophy is that education is a national movement in order that different stakeholders participate in the development of education as a life-long process. As such, the Law recognizes active partnership with local government and other local authorities in the
process of education decentralization.

One of the main purposes of the Law is to inculcate in young minds the respect for human rights, for cultural pluralism and learning to live together, promote morals and character building as well as unity in diversity (Bhinneka Tunggal Eka) in the spirit of brotherhood and solidarity.

The Government recognizes the importance of education as an investment in human capital formation that lays the foundation for future economic growth and development in Indonesia. In that spirit, the Law provides, in compliance with constitutional amendment of 2002 that 20 percent national budget shall be allocated for education. The Government has thus taken a major decision. Keeping in mind that due to the economic crisis, the resources available for the implementation of
universal basic education are limited, the role of the community and parents for the completion of 9-year basic education program is becoming critically important. However, financing of basic education for all shall be primarily the responsibility of the Government.

The Government of Indonesia has immensely benefited from the technical assistance provided by UNESCO for the elaboration of the new Law. It has, thus, been possible to incorporate into the national legislation fundamental principles and norms in the field of the right to education, promoted by UNESCO and United Nation system.

The Ministry of National Education has planned and is carrying out a series of socialization and awareness-raising campaigns throughout the country so that the Law is made widely known. The tripartite government-community-parent cooperation for implementing the new Law needs to be strengthened. Giving shape to the principle of equity as well as empowering role of education for social development is a challenging task in the implementation process.

…
With such a vision of education, national education shall have missions as follows:

1. To strive for the broadening and even distribution of opportunities for quality education for all Indonesian citizens;
2. To assist and facilitate the development of their potentials, from early childhood throughout life, in order to bring into being a learning society;
3. To improve quality of educational inputs and process to optimize the formation of moral character building;
4. To enhance the professionalism and accountability of educational institutions as centers for acculturation of sciences, skills, experiences, attitudes, and values based on national and global standards; and
5. To empower community participation in the provision of education, based on the principles of autonomy in the context of the unity of the Republic of Indonesia.


SUMMARY

The law, passed following stated commitments to the World Education Forum in 2000, reforms the Indonesian educational system, making basic education compulsory and ensuring the independence of higher education institutions.

### Law (UU) No. 22 of 2001 re: Petroleum and Natural Gas

SUMMARY

The law regulates the exploitation and production of petroleum and natural gas in Indonesia, in line with the provision of the Constitution of 1945 affirming that the state controls branches of production important for the state and public life. Requirements and prohibitions are stipulated in relation to business entities in the petroleum and natural gas sectors, with specific requirements for the consultation with and consideration of the affected communities.

CONSULTATION

The law makes it compulsory for business entities undertaking petroleum and natural gas-related activities to engage in the development of surrounding communities, and it stipulates certain areas where communal approval is required for any exploration or exploitation to take place. It also names violating these or any other stipulated requirements as a criminal offense.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

General survey is a range of field activities covering the collection, analysis and presentation of data connected with information on geological conditions in order to predict the location and potential of petroleum and natural gas resources outside the working area.
Exploration is a range of activities aimed at collecting information on the geological condition to find and obtain the estimated reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the stipulated working area.
Exploitation is a series of activities aimed at producing petroleum and natural gas from the stipulated working area, including drilling and completion of wells, and the building of transport, storage and processing facilities.
Working area is a certain region within the Indonesian mining jurisdiction (i.e. all Indonesian mainland, waters and continental shelf territories) used for exploration and exploitation. 
Business entities are companies in the form of statutory bodies permanently and continuously undertaking businesses, established in accordance with the prevailing laws and domiciled and operating in the territory of Indonesia.
Permanent establishments are business entities in the form of statutory bodies established outside the territory of Indonesia that undertake activities within the territories of Indonesia, and are obliged to comply with prevailing Indonesian legislation.

Article 21 states that the plan for the first-time development of a field to be utilized for production activities in a working area must secure the approval of the Minister, based on considerations of the executing agency after consultations with the relevant provincial government. This consultation is needed to ensure that the proposed development plans can be coordinated with provincial governments, especially for regional layout plans and for regional revenues from petroleum and natural gas.

Article 25 states that the government may issue a written warning, suspend or freeze activities, or revoke business licenses in cases of:

Violations against any of the business license requirements.
Repeated violations against business license requirements.
Failure to meet the requirements stipulated in this law.

As this law contains requirements for public consultation, this constitutes a requirement. The business entity shall be given opportunity to fulfill the stipulated violations before the business license is revoked.

Article 33 prohibits petroleum and natural gas-related business activities being executed in:

Cemeteries, places considered sacred, public places, public facilities and infrastructures, nature preserves, cultural preserves and land belonging to communal society.
State defense fields and buildings, as well as the surrounding land.
Historic buildings and state symbols.
Buildings, residences or factories along surrounding yard land, except under a license from government institutions, approval from communities and individuals.

In certain places (unspecified by the law), businesses must secure the prior approval from communities and/or individuals before being granted a license from a government institution. Development in public places and at public facilities and infrastructures, defense fields and buildings requires licenses from the relevant government institutions, the issuance of which must observe suggestions from the communities.

Article 34 states that business entities or permanent establishments planning to utilize land attached to a right must first reach a settlement with the rights holders. This settlement shall be reached through deliberation to reach a consensus, by means of transactions, reasonable compensation, recognition of communal rights of traditional communities based on the relevant communal law, or other forms of compensation to the rights holder.

Article 40 requires business entities and permanent establishments undertaking petroleum and natural gas-related business activities to prioritize the use of local manpower, goods and services, and be responsible for the development of local communities. This development will involve developing and utilizing the potentials and capacities of local communities, e.g. by improving and facilitating the resettlement of communities to foster a harmonious working relationship.

DISCLOSURE

Apart from general requirements for transparency in the dissemination of information from government entities, the most important requirement for public disclosure is the prohibition against disseminating classified information after the expiry of joint cooperation contracts. Such disclosure is named a criminal offense punishable by incarceration or a substantial fine.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public disclosure:

CONSULTATION

Annex 1, Overview Section identifies the importance of community social and environmental resources and values and indicates the company’s responsibility for protection and preservation of community values. Section 8 notes that community inputs are vital in project risk assessments and definitions of the project zone of social impact (social boundaries). Chapter II reiterates the need for stakeholder engagement in project scoping. Chapter IV discusses consultation requirements for the assessment process (especially socialization of planned project activities) and requirements for disclosure of the EIA document (especially disclosure of project risks).


CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

As the requirements are given across five attachments and are not easily sorted, they are here treated jointly, with a short summary for every document concerned. 

Terms of Reference (TOR-EIA/KA-ANDAL)

The Terms of Reference (TOR-EIA) is defined as the scope of environmental impact assessment study, resulting from a scoping process agreed to by the author of AMDAL and the AMDAL Appraisal Commission. The TOR-EIA will formulate the scope and depth of the EIA study and direct the ANDAL study to work effectively and efficiently. 

While the parties directly involved in the preparation of TOR-EIA are the initiator, the responsible government agency, and the constituent EIA study, the implementation, or scoping process, should always involve experts and the community. The scoping process will consist of the scoping of significant impacts and the scoping of the study area and time limit of the study. 

The scoping of significant impacts will be carried out through the following process:

1. Identify all potential environmental impacts likely to arise as a result of the business and/or activity plan, and make an inventory thereof. These impacts will be identified through a series of consultations and discussions with experts, the proponent, responsible agencies, the people concerned and people equipped with field observations. This can be supplemented with other methods, including group interactions.
2. Evaluate all potential impacts in order to remove those impacts considered irrelevant or unimportant. The result of this will be list of important potential impacts to be studied in-depth in the EIA study. This list shall be based on the results of consultation with the community around the business and/or activity, the responsible agencies and experts.
3. Classify significant impacts and organize them after priority for the further study in the EIA document. This classification will consider a) the policies/regulations forming the basis for further EIA study direction; and b) the scientific concept of the study to be conducted.

The scoping of the study area and the time limit of the study shall take into account limitations on resources, time and effort, as well as the opinions, suggestions and responses from the affected community. It will be carried out through the following process:

1. The scope of the EIA study area will be based on the assessment of the following spatial borders:
a. The Project Boundary, which is the space where the pre-construction, construction and operational activities of the business and/or activity plan will take place. 
b. The Ecological Boundary, which is the impact distribution space of the business and/or activity plan according to the transport medium, where natural processes are expected to experience fundamental change.
c. The Social Boundary, which is the space of various social interactions around the proposed business and/or activity, which will contain certain norms and values. Within this boundary, community groups whose socio-economic and cultural life will experience fundamental due to the proposed business and/or activity will be identified.
d. The Administrative Boundary, which is the space in which people are free to conduct socio-economic and socio-cultural activities in accordance with prevailing legislation. 
e. The EIA Study Area Scope Boundary, which is a space uniting the four other boundaries and tailored to the capability of its determination, typically facing limitations of data sources such as time, money, energy, engineering and methods of review.
2. The scope of the EIA study time limit will be set in consideration of the time constraints facing the implementation of the business and/or activity plans. This will be used to make forecasts and evaluate the impact of the EIA study.

Environmental Management Plan (EMP/RKL)

The Environmental Management Plan (RKL) is a plan devised to handle significant environmental impacts caused by the business and/or activity plan, detailing measures to prevent, control and cope with significant environmental impacts. This will include four groups of environmental management activities:
1. Efforts to avoid or prevent negative environmental impacts through the selection of alternatives in terms of layout, location and project design.
2. Efforts to overcome, minimize or control negative impacts due to the business and/or activity, through all stages of the project.
3. Efforts to increase the positive impacts arising from the business and/or activity in terms of benefits to the initiator and/or other parties.
4. Consideration of environmental economics as a basis for providing compensation for resources that cannot be recovered or that have been lost or damaged, both socio-economic and ecological, as a result of the business and/or activity.

The formulation of the RKL is required to define the approach utilized in the environmental management plan. One of the alternative approaches listed is the socio-economic approach, which comprises efforts to overcome significant impact through measures based on social interaction.

The law also stipulates certain requirements for the collection and management of data, requiring all such data to be the property of the State and applying periods of secrecy depending on the type of information.

CONSULTATION

The requirements for consultation primarily concern the usage of land charged with land right and the requirement for contractors to participate in community development. For land where other parties hold land rights or communally owned lands, the designation of such land as work areas needs to be preceded by consultation and consensus, resulting in a settlement. Where traditional law communities are concerned, this consultation and consensus must take traditional law into account.

Article 26 states that one of the minimum provisions to be contained in the cooperation contract is the development of local communities and guarantees of the rights of traditional communities.

Article 62 states that a contractor intending to utilize land under rights or state lands as part of its work area must first make a settlement for the use of the land with the rights holder or the user of state land. These rights holders include traditional law communities, whose traditionally used land will be affected by construction. The community holding the land rights or the user of state land, in turn, is required to permit a contractor to conduct exploration and exploitation on the concerned land, provided the contractor has shown the cooperation contract (or a legalized copy of it) and reached a settlement for the use of land or has provided the guarantee of a settlement approved by the concerned party.

Article 63 states that settlements as meant in Article 62 shall be achieved through consultation and consensus with the holder of land rights or the user of state land. This may be done directly with the holder of land rights or user of state land through sale and purchase, exchange, suitable indemnification, recognition or other forms of compensation. Settlements for the use of land in the form of recognition or other compensation may be in the form of:

on the basis of deliberations to achieve consensus in accordance with local traditional law, in the case of indemnification for traditional collectively owned land;
plots of land ready for building;
replacement land;
basic or very basic housing, with home ownership loan (KPR) facilities;
apartments or real estate with KPR facilities;
relocation; or
other forms of compensation.

Should a traditional law community collectively own the land, the methods of consultation and consensus must pay due attention to the decision-making procedures of that community. Compensation for such land shall be given in the form of construction of public facilities or other vorms of benefit for the local community. For religious endowment land (wakaf) or other religious observance land, indemnification shall be given in the form of land, buildings and facilities as necessary.

Article 64 states that in cases where the number of community members holding rights to land or users of state land is too large for effective consultations to be done, the consultations may be carried out partially or with a representative. This representative shall be appointed by and acting on behalf of the rights holders with a power of attorney duly made in accordance with prevailing legislation. If consensus can still not be achieved through deliberations, the parties may appoint another party in accordance with prevailing laws.

Article 65 states that the determination of indemnification for land will be based on the results of consultation. 

Articles 72 to 77 require contractors conducting upstream business activities to develop local communities in coordination with the Regional Government, in accordance with the applicable laws. The responsibilities for this development are 1) participation in the development and utilization of the potential capabilities of the local community, including by employing workforce in specified quantities and qualities in line with the required competences; and 2) upgrading the living environment of the community to achieve harmonious relations between the contractor and the surrounding community. The participation in community development shall be provided in the form of physical facilities and infrastructure, or of empowerment of local enterprises and workforce. The contractor shall allocate funds for this development in each annual work plan and budget, and priority shall be given to communities near the areas where exploitation is carried out. 

Article 79 requires contractors to prioritize the use of domestic goods, services, technology, and engineering and design capabilities in a transparent and competitive manner. This could, by extension, require consultation should these items be found in the local communities (for instance in the form of workforce).

Article 82 requires contractors to place priority on the use of Indonesian manpower, and to use foreign manpower only in cases where the required expertise cannot be found in Indonesian personnel. 

Articles 84 and 85 require contractors to carry out guidance, education and training programs for Indonesian workers in order to develop their capabilities. This development will be carried out in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
