# Data Collection Checklists

## Daily Protocol for Collection and Maintenance of Field Data

**Morning:**

1. Record where you currently are, your objectives for the day, and your planned travel route.
2. Record any desired observations about the fieldwork process, including reflections on past engagement, ideas to explore in the future, etc.

**Evening:**

1. Record where you have been during the day.
2. Note whether any affected people were encountered.  If multiple groups were encountered, note how many.
3. Verify that any data recorded is correctly indexed and verify cross-references to other data-collection tools (e.g. ID# of photos taken, GIS coordinates and corresponding ID#, consultation records, etc.).
4. Back-up data and ensure equipment is appropriately disbursed among team members


## Per Encounter<sup>* </sup> Protocol in support of Fieldwork Objectives

<sup>* </sup>Where an encounter occurs and is concluded in a single day, time should be made to record and document that encounter immediately after it concludes and prior to seeking out the next community of affected people.  Where an encounter occurs over the course of more than one day, time should be made to record structured data both in the morning and toward the end of each day.

1. Introduce field team and purpose of study.
2. Ask for permission to engage. If acceptable, continue to carry out engagement activities.  If not acceptable, make sure that you ask for the personâ€™s name and ask if she/he can verbally clarify the areas that our team should avoid in the future.  Record outcomes.
3. Ask for permission to take photographs. If acceptable, take one group photograph.  As appropriate and non-intrusive, take 1 or 2 photographs of the consultation process taking place (e.g., having a conversation, recording data, or conducting a consultation/disclosure activity). If not acceptable, note this.
4. Collect GIS coordinates of the location of the encounter.
5. Note the number of people encountered; ask or guess the approximate ages of each member and general state of visible health.
6. Note any observations about the people encountered.  How were they clothed?  What equipment did they have? Note these or any other indications of trade or acculturation to coastal communities.
