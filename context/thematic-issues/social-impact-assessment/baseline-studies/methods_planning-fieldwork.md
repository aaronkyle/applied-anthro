### Field Study Implementation - Logistical Planning

#### Provisional Itinerary of Activities On Site - Prescriptive Considerations for Project Planning

Field study implementation will following a prescribed agenda of activities that can be roughly understood as follows:

1. Day 1: Arrival, Introductions and Initial Investigations

* The ESMS team arrives in the study village and meets with the local Village Head (*Kepala Desa*) and other local notables to introduce the team members and to review the purpose and scope of survey activities.  Team members sub-divide themselves into data collection groups, with some individuals designated to facilitate FGDs/PRAs, some to serve as FGD data recorders, and some designated with responsibility for conducing questionnaire surveys. ESMS team co-leads work with field team members to ensure that data collection is being carried out appropriately. ESMS team co-leads also work independently with local stakeholder to address specific data-collection objectives, defined per *kecamatan*.

1. Days 2,3 & 4 [according to sample requirements]

* Household questionnaires and FGD/PRA session continue, addressing thematic issues of interest (including FGD session with vulnerable groups / special interest stakeholder groups)
* On the final day of studies, the ESMS team prepares for departure.  In some cases, the field team may not be able to stay overnight in a target study village; in such cases the team will prepare daily transportation bewteen the field site and the site of local accommodations.


#### Factoring for time and transportation

In the following provisional field schedule, consideration has been given to contingency planning and the likelihood of delays and the need for scheduling revisions.

#### Preliminary Schedules

Consultancy proposes that supplementary baseline field studies occur in two parts. Splitting the survey into two parts accounts for the expanded  scope of the study and accomodates different logistical challenges that correspond with seasonal change--particularly challenges associated with sea travel. A phased approach also allows for follow-up on data requests made to specific government partners.

The first round of fieldwork will be occur in March 2015 and will focus on village communities on the island of Yamdena that are accessible by road. The second round of fieldwork will occur in June 2015 and will focus on villages on Selaru Island as well as commmunities in the north of Yamdena Island and on Larat Island. **ANNEX 5** provides an overview of study groupings according to fieldwork component; it further shows how study sites will be distributed across ESMS study teams. **ANNEX 6** provides a detailed (daily) schedule for ESMS team site visits.
