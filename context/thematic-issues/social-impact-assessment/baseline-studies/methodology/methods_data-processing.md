### Post-Fieldwork Data Processing and Reporting

Compilation and reporting of the supplementary baseline results will be produced progressively, with initial processing undertaken after the first period of fieldwork. The final ESMS supplementary baseline report will be completed after the second phase of field research. Quantitative statistical analysis of questionnaire data will be combined with context and thematic analysis of the FGD material.
