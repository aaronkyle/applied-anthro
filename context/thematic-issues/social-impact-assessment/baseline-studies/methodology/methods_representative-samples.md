### Determination of a 'Representative Sample'

%% {[NOT YET INTEGRATED]} %%

The total number of villages in MTB in the year 2010 is being used as a proxy measure to establish a representative sample within the project's 'social area of impact'.  The client acknowledges that it will be a project of regional significance, and definition of 'area of influence' will continue to be reformulated and refined during the process of social impact assessment.  The significance of this measurement is to establish an appropriate survey size.

To help ensure that the survey team interacts directly with a 'representative sample' of the regional area of influence, Consultancy grouped villages according to arithmetic quartiles by population and sought to balance site selection accordingly.

MTB kabupaten population, mean: 105,341/71 = 1483.676 [1484]

No. MTB villages above mean =  28

//  re-factored mean for top half = 71,232=/28 [2,544]

* top [\geq 2,544] = 5 villages
* mid-top [2,544 - 1,484] = 23 villages

No. MTB villages below mean = 43

//  re-factored mean for top half (mean re-factored) = 34,809/43 [793]

* mid-bottom  [1,483 - 793] = 18 villages
* bottom = [\leq 792] = 26 villages

This methodology extends the number of study villages to achieve a more balanced and representative sample, as well as to better demonstrate how the project is attending to the IFC prescript to ensure that the impact assessment process accounts especially for 'vulnerable communities' (i.e., by giving suitable weighting to the representation of small and isolated communities that may be exposed to project-induced indirect impacts, such as price inflation).

{[ADJUST STATEMENT]}
As calculated in the table above and reflected in the graphics below, the distribution of ESMS social baseline study locations achieves a rough approximation of regional composition with respect to population size.

FIGURE: 2

Primary baseline data collection in each village sets numerical targets for the number of survey participants according to confidence values of 80% and margin of error calculations varying between 0.25 and 0.5. Consultancy will use a combination of household questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions to effect a rapid rural appraisal that reaches representative sample population targets //%%{[SECTION]}%%//.  The target number of participants for FGD sessions is calculated according to MTB 2010 village population quartile values. ESMS supplementary social baseline implementation schedules were created by calculating village days according to the estimated number of FGDs that can be completed in one day (6 total; refer to //%%{[SECTION]}%%//).

### Selection of Study Sites

Consultancy and client agreed to the following parameters for supplementary baseline site selection:

   * sample size should seek to achieve a defensible statistical representation of the social field; no less than 35% confidence level for regional "area of influence" (minimum of 17 villages)
   * full representation of directly affected communities [equivalent to 'priority directly-affected communities' (PDAC)in the terminology of the client *Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan* (PCDP)]
   * partial representation (ca. 40% - 80%) of areas likely to be exposed to project-induced direct and indirect socio-economic impacts ('directly-affected communities' DAC)
   * partial representation (ca. 10% - 40%) of areas that may indirectly be affected by project-induced socio-economic change, or those area where there is a vocal stakeholder perception or belief that such changes may occur ('indirectly-affected communities' IAC)

Additional parameters influencing Consultancy' proposed field sites selection include:

  - proximity and distance from key project activity zones, especially the administrative and economic center of Saumlaki, the capital of MTB, as well as the planned on-shore LSB site and port facilities in neighboring Olilit Village.
  - distances from port facilities / accessibility by regular forms transportation [proximity to transportation hubs affects the likelihood a village will experience in-migration]
  - distance from healthcare and treatment facilities [availability of, and access to, health and educational services affect the extent to which communities' vulnerability may be impacted by the project]
  - available production land in village [derived from BPN statistics, this measurement indicates the potential of a village community to expand agricultural output in response to added population pressures]
 - due consideration of existing social, demographic, linguistic, geographical and economic data [MTB has several distinctive language groups, the number of which is a matter of scholarly debate; at least five major groups can be distinguished]
 - due consideration of timing, capacity constraints and the logistics of access

Consultancy' proposed selection criteria seeks to extend the geographic coverage of study sites to better account for potential project-induced changes in northern parts of MTB and other more distant villages--such as those that may be affected by speculative flows of immigrants or particularly remote and impoverished villages that are relatively more vulnerable to shocks of regional economic change.  We recognize, however, that  much of the west coast of MTB's Yamdena Island is not accessible by road, and a number of populated islands in the northwest and northeast of Yamdena cannot be readily reached by means of sea transport meeting client' quality, health and safety standards.  Consultancy will work with client to revise and finalize final field site selection.

Following the above parameters and considerations, the Consultancy team recommends selection of the below villages for village-level collection of supplementary baseline data:

What is a large enough sample size?

It highly depends, If you want to make inferences on the total population you need to determine what margin of error and what confidence level you can allow for. These will then help you determine the needed sample size. 

If we would want to estimate the population mean $\mu$. The maximum difference between the sample mean $\bar x$ and $\mu$ is given by: 

$$ \epsilon = z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}  $$

Where $n$ is the sample size, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is commonly called the critical value which is derived from the standard normal distribution. These values can be found in tables or using r or python, e.g 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level. 

Knowing $\sigma$ (you usually don't) will allow you to determine the sample size needed to approximate $\mu$ within $\pm \epsilon $ with a confidence level of $1-\alpha$. You can try using $\sigma =  \frac{1}{2}$ which is usually enough. There exists methods for determining $\sigma$ as well. Anyhow, you may rearrange the above relation as follows: 

$$ n = \bigg ( \frac{z_\frac{\alpha}{2}\sigma }{\epsilon}  \bigg )^2 $$

In fact, this question is quite hard to answer. There are many factors that determine the sample size needed for your study. You should definitely go through some material on basic statstics starting with 
[Awesome probability theory][1] and go on studying inferential statistics.    

It is worth taking some time to understand what the total population is in your case and with regard to the inferential question, does the sample include enough relevant observations? I do not feel that enough info is given in your question to provide a good answer.  

You may look at similar surveys conducted and see what sample sizes they have used. 

Another common approach, when you don't know much about your population is using *Slovin's formula* : 

$$n = \frac{N}{(1+N \epsilon ^2)}$$

Where $N$ is the total population. As an example given a confidence level of 98% $\rightarrow \epsilon = 0.02$  and a total population of 600. we would get  

$$n = \frac{600}{1+600\times0.02^2} = 484.$$

Note that *Slovin's formula*  is easily misused but can give you a good starting point. 

I would highly recommend studying statistics if you are planning to continue working with DS.

Hope this provided some help at least.
