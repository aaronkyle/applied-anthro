Pro-active planning begins with project design and planning, when explicit consideration of the project’s potential physical and social footprint should lead to integrated projects that take into account a project’s potential social and economic impacts and local and regional development consequences. 

At the outset, the project should ask and answer the following questions:

* What are the opportunities to include social considerations in project design and planning?
* What trade-offs exist between project-defined optimal design and “socially optimal” design?
* How will the project benefit from proactive management of social considerations?

Project social development design and budget decisions are made throughout the project cycle and must change in response to the outcomes of formal environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) and resulting management plans. At the time of initial project planning, clients have the option to begin planning for its real or expected benefits in short- and long-term horizons.

Attached with this email is an Excel file containing over 175 tools for social performance evaluation.  I haven't had time to go through each of them.  Some are clearly more relevant than others (and I deleted out already those that were wildly off topic).  My impression is that there really are no standard approach to social performance evaluation, and any metrics used to assess a project are highly context specific.  Unless a project has defined in advance how it wishes to evaluate social performance, there seems to be little that one can learn if trying to perform such an evaluation after the fact -- at least, not without a ton of added legwork.

### Tools for Capturing Primary Baseline Data

It is critical to design surveys to withstand scrutiny across disciplines.

add methods discussion here: there are many methods for data-collection, including FDG, KII, etc.

Not finding what I was looking for on the web concerning socio-economic survey design, I started writing about it [here](https://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues/social-impact-assessment/baseline-studies).
