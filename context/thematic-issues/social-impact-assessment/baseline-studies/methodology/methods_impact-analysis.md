### On-Going Impact Identification and Analysis: Proactive Planning to Enable a Robust M&E Framework

A 'household and community resources framework' us a a tool to organize basedline data to facilitate impact identification and analysis and to help inform the on-going development and refinement of action plans for impact mitigation and sustainable social development. This 'resources framework' approach to data organization draws on social research theory and has been applied to IFC client projects. Existing social baseline provide a partial dataset to inform analysis using the 'resources framework' approach; ESMS supplimentary baseline field studies seek to help fill remaining gaps ahead of the social impact assessment studies.

There are eight categories of resources under the framework:

1. human resources
2. social resources
3. cultural and religious resources
4. environmental resources
5. natural resources
6. livelihood resources
7. housing resources
8. basic services


#### Human Resources

The availability of labor, education and skills determine how a household can exploit livelihood resources available to it. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money.The health and nutrition of the family are fundamental to a minimum level of well-being. Households with limited labour availability consisting of children, the elderly and infirm are more vulnerable to project impacts.

#### Social Resources

Trust in institutions is essential for social cohesion and well-being. Households form part of a community within a traditional and political setting. Households are typically dependent on a combination of family, community, traditional and political networks to gain access to land, housing and livelihood resources. Local community, traditional and political institutions can provide safety and security for households in time of natural and political disaster.


#### Cultural and Religious Resources

Common belief systems frame the existence of communities and provide psychological security to households. Culture and religion provide an identity and structure to households to engage and support one another.

#### Environmental Resources

Households and communities depend on the biophysical environment to maintain their health, safety and livelihoods. Disruptions to the quality of air, water, soil can impact negatively on the health and stability of households.

#### Natural Resources

Access to land, freshwater bodies, forests, marine and other natural resources is critical for the world’s population in providing ecosystem services including timber, medicines, food, and genetic resources, among others. Access to these resources is governed by community, traditional and political institutions.

#### Livelihood Resources

Livelihood activities (land, marine, wage and enterprise-based), remittances, bartering and labour exchanges contribute to household incomes and assets. Livelihood activities may include cropping, grazing, hunting, fishing, gathering, etc. and may derive from both agricultural and on-agricultural sources. A household’s access to livelihood resources is dependent on social, traditional and political institutions.

#### Housing Resources

Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people’s lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. Shelter is one of the most basic requirements of any household that can be a major determinant of health. The tenure to residential land and dwelling is critical to guaranteeing shelter and livelihoods to households.

#### Access to Basic Services

Access to basic services including water supply, sanitation, education and health is a determinant of a household’s health and ability to exploit livelihood opportunities.
