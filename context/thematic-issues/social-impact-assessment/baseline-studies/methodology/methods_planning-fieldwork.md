#### Logistical Planning for Questionnaire Household Surveys

--

**Characterization of Questionnaire Surveys**

* structured
* semi-random (tracking households interviewed, if possible)

---

ESMS supplementary baseline questionnaire surveys will last approximately one hour in duration. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 1 minute (60 questions/hour)--although it is possible for a skilled enumerator and rapid respondent to make it through 1 question every 10 seconds (360 questions/hour).

Enumerators will ask as many questions as possible within that hour according to a structured interview schedule organized in priority 'modules'. In situations where enumerators are able to work through a multitude of questions, they will be asked to work through (and select) different sheets in order of priority.

Order of priority for structured surveys is as follows:

- identity distribution
- livelihoods
- living conditions
- health / security conditions
- access to basic services
- territorial ties / population mobility
- household composition
- asset ownership

The ESMS baseline schedule anticipates that one field enumerator can conduct 6 one-hour surveys in one day, and to keep this pace for a maximum of three days between rests.  Combining days of rest with transportation between and around study sites to maximize productive time, each period of ESMS field survey can only be reasonably planned for periods of up to four weeks in duration.

Dedicating two enumerators per team full-time to this task would allow for up to a maximum of 468 one-on-one interviews to be gathered during fieldwork. Sampling 468 people provides only ca. 60% confidence values for a populations of 105,341 [MTB total population according to BPS 2010 data] at a 0.018% degree of accuracy. This means that questionnaire surveys cannot be relied on alone to describe village socio-economic conditions with a high degree of certainty that the results reflect normal distributions (e.g., incidents of disease within a village).

#### Logistical Planning for Focus Group Discussions / Participatory Rapid Appraisal
----

**Characterization of FGD / PRA**

* semi-structured
* targeted population groups

----

As indicated above, representative village profiles cannot be rapidly generated based entirely on structured, one-on-one questionnaire surveys.  For this reason, the ESMS supplementary social baseline field team will utilize focus group discussions (FGDs) and participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) as alternative forms of data collection.


FGD sessions will last approximately 2 hours. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 3 minutes (20 questions/hour; 40 total), though it is possible to realize a response rate around 1 question every 2 minutes (30 questions/hour; 60 total). The ESMS team would be expected to be able to conduct between 3 and 4 FGD/PRA sessions on any given day.  Over the duration of a one-month study, the range of expected FGD/PRA studies is between 57 and 76 individual sessions.  Limiting the number of respondents for each session to a maximum of 16 people, the top potential number of respondents to be interviewed via FGD/PRA sessions is 1,216 people in total.

The order of topical priority for focus group discussions will follow a similar overall progression as that of the questionnaire survey questions. For each participating village community a standard set of topics will be raised in gender disaggregated FGD/PRA with community members covering key areas of Project interest, and likely impact, including (a) socio-economic livelihoods (b) cultural heritage and the role of tradition/ dispute resolution in the village (c) health and other services; and (d) community security.  

In addition to the standard set of topics, FGD facilitators will have discretion in selecting among one or more site specific themes to explore according to  particular conditions and circumstances of interest to FDD participants. Example topics include:

  * marine / coastal focused livelihoods
  * government services and access
  * livelihood opportunities and development constraints
  * gender, family and health

The ESMS supplementary baseline survey will utilize FGDs to gather data and insights from targeted stakeholder groups, including women, the disabled and vulnerable as well as youth groups and the elderly. FGD facilitators will create an environment in which stakeholders feel comfortable to share their views openlyâ€”providing a safe space and a chance for everyone speak freely.



### Field Study Implementation - Logistical Planning

#### Provisional Itinerary of Activities On Site - Prescriptive Considerations for Project Planning

Field study implementation will following a prescribed agenda of activities that can be roughly understood as follows:

1. Day 1: Arrival, Introductions and Initial Investigations

* The ESMS team arrives in the study village and meets with the local Village Head (*Kepala Desa*) and other local notables to introduce the team members and to review the purpose and scope of survey activities.  Team members sub-divide themselves into data collection groups, with some individuals designated to facilitate FGDs/PRAs, some to serve as FGD data recorders, and some designated with responsibility for conducing questionnaire surveys. ESMS team co-leads work with field team members to ensure that data collection is being carried out appropriately. ESMS team co-leads also work independently with local stakeholder to address specific data-collection objectives, defined per *kecamatan*.

1. Days 2,3 & 4 [according to sample requirements]

* Household questionnaires and FGD/PRA session continue, addressing thematic issues of interest (including FGD session with vulnerable groups / special interest stakeholder groups)
* On the final day of studies, the ESMS team prepares for departure.  In some cases, the field team may not be able to stay overnight in a target study village; in such cases the team will prepare daily transportation bewteen the field site and the site of local accommodations.


#### Factoring for time and transportation

In the following provisional field schedule, consideration has been given to contingency planning and the likelihood of delays and the need for scheduling revisions.

#### Preliminary Schedules

Consultancy proposes that supplementary baseline field studies occur in two parts. Splitting the survey into two parts accounts for the expanded  scope of the study and accomodates different logistical challenges that correspond with seasonal change--particularly challenges associated with sea travel. A phased approach also allows for follow-up on data requests made to specific government partners.

The first round of fieldwork will be occur in March 2015 and will focus on village communities on the island of Yamdena that are accessible by road. The second round of fieldwork will occur in June 2015 and will focus on villages on Selaru Island as well as commmunities in the north of Yamdena Island and on Larat Island. **ANNEX 5** provides an overview of study groupings according to fieldwork component; it further shows how study sites will be distributed across ESMS study teams. **ANNEX 6** provides a detailed (daily) schedule for ESMS team site visits.
