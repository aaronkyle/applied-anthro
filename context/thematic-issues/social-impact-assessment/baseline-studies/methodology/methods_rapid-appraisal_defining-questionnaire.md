## Rapid Appraisal

The term 'Rapid Appraisal' refers to a systematic, semi-structured field activity by a multidisciplinary team, designed to obtain new information and formulate new hypotheses regarding rural life. RRA emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the team, as it should have a wide representation of skills and tools at its disposal.

### methods for gathering quantitative data within a short time frame


#### Capture / Analysis of Existing Government Data

Governments collect socio-economic data--and often lots of it. These data they provide can be utilized to help inform ongoing analysis of potential project-induced impacts to local communities. Unfortunately, however, these data tend to be unstructured and collected in formats to readily amenable to quantitive analysis.

For example, [Badan Pusat Statistik](https://mtbkab.bps.go.id/) (BPS) of Maluku Tenggara Barat works with kecamatan-level governments to produce annual reports of socio-economic and health data in a series referred to collectively in this methodology as the BPS *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series, which collects a series of high-level indicator data for each siub-district government within region.   Comparative analysis of MTB *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* demonstrates that reporting is  uneven for most socio-economic variables--to an extent that severely limits current capacity to use these data in studies of social change and sustainable development. The distribution of topics varies greatly and few variable measures are uniformly disaggregated to the village level. Even fewer variables desegregate according to gender. The varying integrity of each underlying dataset and mistakes resulting from the process of government reporting and client re-capture are also processes certain to have introduced errors. Aanalysis, therefore, is involves substantial interpretation and application of 'professional judgment'.

International development projects can contribute on-going technical assistance to re-constitute, clean, and verify MTB government village-level data in a manner that is helpful for social analysis.  We will continue integrating government data sources as they become available to us.  Allowes are made within the scope of this methodology to pursue data access by working directly with key stakeholder informants. %%{[REFERENCE METHODOLOGY SECTION]}%%.  Consultancy will continue to seek access to data from the 2010 Indonesian Census, which records to the household level across the country.


### key informant interviews

Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) are one-on-one interviews and discussions. KIIs are a common technique for gathering specific information.  Such information may range from insights into stakeholder perspectives on such issues as social dynamics within a particular community or internal politics within a company or government agency.  KIIs rely on the knowledge and connections of particular individuals, such as sources of authority about a certain topic, or those with special access to data. KIIs are among the most commonly used methods of data collection for ‘needs assessment’, ethnographic or sociological research, monitoring and evaluation, and may also factor into safety audits and human rights monitoring.

Order of priority for targeted interviews is as follows:

- general census and socio-economic data
   * focusing especially on interviews with adat leaders, elderly women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), teachers, local business owners and other local notables

- health data
   * accessing inputs from healthcare practitioners (including Puskesmas representatives) and traditional healers

- information on sources and costs of basic services (access to water, food, medical treatment, and education)
   * focusing especially on interviews with  women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), commercial agencies supplying services; government agencies supplying services

- productivity of local markets by resource type
   * accessing inputs from suppliers, merchants, traders, local business owners and other local notables

- information on sources and costs of building supplies and materials
   * focusing especially on interviews with people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), local homeowners and local business owners


client has requested Consultancy--in addition to household surveys and FGD/PRA session--to gather updated socio-economic and census data from local institutions and government agencies.   ESMS supplementary baseline field team will dedicate at least one field researcher to pursuing secondary data access from local authorities and institutions.

It is very likely possible to improve coverage of available socio-economic data for baseline study by requesting materials directly from data suppliers.  The following government and civic groups supply the raw data upon which all *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series are generated :

1.	Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika Saumlaki / Stasiun Meteorologi Saumlaki
1.	Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Desa Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Badan Pusat Statistik
	- Badan Pusat Statistik ( Pemetaan Wilayah )
	- Badan Pusat Statistik (PODES)
	- BPS dan BPMD Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Data Dasar Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kelautan dan Perikanan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kesehatan Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Pendidikan, Pemuda, dan Olahraga Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat

%%{[INSERT ANNEX 3: Comparison of Needed Government Indicator Data by Kecamatan and Topical Category]}%%

Local-level (*kecamaten*) government agencies currently support data collection for some districts. To the extent possible, the  ESMS team will also solicit access to data from the *Kantor Kecamatan* and from and *Puskesmas* facility located within target study villages



### tools and techniques for surveys at individual and household levels


#### Questionnaire Household Surveys

A questionnaire household survey is a method of direct data collection. General census surveys tend to ask a large number of questions in order to describe comparatively large populations.  A questionnaire household survey is a shorter form of questionnaire survey that focuses on a narrowly-defined set of targeted inquiries and collects data from only a small representative sample of respondents. Close-ended  design helps to facilitate a quantifiable dataset for subsequent statistical analysis, but these surveys are limited in how their results can credibly be generalized or extrapolated. Short surveys are therefore used primarily to augment and verify existing data sources. ESMS questionnaire surveys will therefore focus on obtaining nuanced quantification and measurements from respondents that are less likely to vary according to individual circumstances (e.g., costs, distances, time, and common forms of infrastructure) but reflect community-wide practice or experience. //%% {[IMPROVE]} %%//


#### Focus Group Discussions / Participatory Rapid Appraisal

Focus group discussions utilize an interactive group setting to facilitate rapid data collection, especially on topics that can be explored in depth via participant interaction. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) are typically small and informal gatherings where a facilitator guides conversations on pre-establish topics of interest. The forum encourages complexity of responses, behaviors and motivations. FGDs also provide contextual data and immediate feedback on research design and methodology.

The advantages of FGD and PRA over questionnaire survey is that they can allow for the simultaneous collection of feedback from a number of respondents in a format that is also conducive to allowing respondents to collectively deliberate and adjust their responses--often improving the robustness and accuracy of the results.  FGD and PRA forms of data gathering are especially well suited to situations where respondents are being asked to enumerate varieties of different resources or when being asked to recall information about collective activities and shared cultural beliefs and values (such as the location of sacred sites, claims to communal land, or areas of cultural significance). FGDs can also be helpful in identifying points of disagreement between individual stakeholders and investigating the degree of shared understanding on a topic. FGDs are not, however, a formal means of consensus or decision-making and facilitators are cautioned not to attempt to resolve conflicts or to formalize any decision or course of action.

The disadvantages of FGD and PRA relative to questionnaire surveys is that oftentimes fewer questions can be covered on a single topic (since greater time and attention is spent on deliberating and refining answers). FGD and PRA are also more heavily dependent on the skill of their facilitators and data-recorders to capture 'survey' style data (such as the number of people living in houses built from different types of materials).  For this reason, FGD and PRA discussion topics and priority questions need to be carefully designed and practiced in advance of fieldwork.  Additionally, both the facilitators and the data-recorders need to be closely familiar with the full range of target questions and capable of shifting quickly among priority topics according to respondent interests. FGDs are less useful for gathering statistical data. It is also more challenging to conduct focus groups when language barriers are insurmountable or when the situation is not under the facilitator’s control.

The ESMS supplementary baseline survey will utilize FGDs to gather data and insights from targeted stakeholder groups, including women, the disabled and vulnerable as well as youth groups and the elderly. FGD facilitators will create an environment in which stakeholders feel comfortable to share their views openly—providing a safe space and a chance for everyone speak freely.

### 'Triangulation' of data sources

'Triangulation' is a term used by social scientists to describe the the technique of integrating multiple lines of analysis to ensure the integrity of data sources and analytical practices. The term 'triangulation' is borrowed from navigational techniques for locating a single point in multi-dimensional space by evaluating the convergence of measurements from other distinct points. The idea is that one can be more confident with a result of data collection and analysis if different methods lead to the same outcomes. Triangulation can be used in both quantitative (validation) and qualitative (inquiry) studies and is particularly well suited when one seeks to establish the credibility of qualitative analyses. Triangulation of information also helps overcome limitations imposed on qualitative studies via sampling criteria for reliability and validity combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and empirical materials, researchers can hope to overcome the weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from single method, single-observer and single-theory studies.

The ESMS supplementary social baseline studies compile following sources of data to facilitate triangulation of data to inform social impact analysis:

  1. government statistics
  2. limited household surveys
  3. focus group discussions (FGD) / participatory rapid appraisal (PRA)
  4. key informant interviews
