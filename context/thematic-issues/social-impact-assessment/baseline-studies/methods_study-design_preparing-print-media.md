## Preparing survey questions into a printed format for fieldwork.

To facilitate survey work, teams will need to specify which questions will be raised during semi-structured surveys and which will be raised during focus group discussions (FGDs).

Subsequently, the team can arrange questions in a manner that can be easily completed by fieldworkers.

In this process, some questions will be arranged in tabular format.

NOTE: This is indicated in the survey forms using a light blue / light purple color.
