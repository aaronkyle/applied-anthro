## Context

International development projects often aim to bolster regional and national prosperity, as defined in economic terms (e.g. job creation, enhanced market access).  To deliver on these promises, it is incumbent on project proponents to define and measure the precise nature and form of such position economic change--and to be alert to a project's potential for negative impacts. Especially where a project is conceived as part of national and regional development strategies, it is important to establishing a measurable performance baselines that anticipate and account for project-induced direct, indirect, and cumulative changes to host communities (i.e. structures of governance and societal organization, demographic measures of well-being,  cultural identity, etc).

This document sets out some rationale and methodology for establishing a 'regional baseline' via village and household social surveys and contextual analysis that is both grounded in theory and informed by applied practice implementing action plans for large, complex  projects in developing countries. Underpinning this methodology is a simple 'resource framework' that identifies indicators and questions to measure long-term project induced changes (and to help refine the definition of 'affected communities' throughout the lifetime of this project). This approach provides a coherent and practical way to understand social impacts of the project by combining both household and community-level investigations. The framework acknowledges that household and community well-being is dependent upon a range of tangible and intangible resources and informed by IFC Performance Standards.

To help mitigate the challenges of discussing issues in the abstract, the discussion takes as an example an imaginary development project situated on a remote island group in Indonesia, known administratively as Maluku Tenggara Barat (MTB) and Maluku Barat Daya (MBD) [and known informally as the Tanimbar Islands].

MTB is characterized by two major population concentrations--one in the south, centered around Saumlaki, and the other in the north, centered around Larat.  These population centers developed partially in response to historic political rivalries.

This analysis examines the scope of 'project area of social influence' tohttps://github.com/aaronkyle/social-development/tree/master/context/thematic-issues/social-impact-assessment/baseline-studies account for the potential of project-induced impacts also to northern village&mdash;gathering data especially that can help to evaluate potential impacts induced by speculative in-migration, as well as other indirect and cumulative impacts.

The following discussion of methods seeks to ensure that site selection and sampling are rationally determined according to proximate understandings of 'impact' and that the approach is cost-effective&mdash;leveraging secondary data sources such as census data, socio-economic and health surveys and by conducting primary research in the form of village and household level surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions.
