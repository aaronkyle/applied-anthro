summary: 
-->

This post lists (and attempts to establish some manner of categorising) social policy among international financial institutions (IFIs).

I compiled (and am publicly sharing) this index because I have found it difficult to identify and compare social policy within and among institutions.

----

**A brief aside about terminology**

In policy, terminology is important. Comparative analysis of social policy is a particularly challenging topic for maintaining terminological clarity and consistency. Over the years, I have worked to develop my own definitions for terms used in social policy (a defining feature of the [applied-anthro](http://applied-anthro.com/) website) to ensure clarity and continuity in my writing. This lexicon is influenced by the IFI definitions, but it is adapted to accomodate discussion of broad phenomenological concerns. 

Consider the following:

Most IFIs compile some form of **operations manual** comprised of policies for effecting the mandates of their institutional charters. In addition to board-approved policies and regulations, some IFI **operations manuals** also include notes of guidance for bank staff and clients that elaborate on the intended meaning of policy provisions to facilitate better implementation.

For example, while the Asian Development Bank's operations manual refers only to policies (which the ADB terms **operational procedures**, or OPs), the operations manual of the World Bank contains **operational policies** (OPs), **bank procedures** (BPs), **directives**, as well as interim instructions to staff (referred to OpMemos).

It can be hard to distinguish 'policy' from 'guidance', and still more difficult to discern what is "required" as opposed to that which is simply "recommended" (a question that my clients often pose when considering my recommendations for policy implementation).

It can also be challenging to identify the range of social policy that may be applicable to a given project or development initiative. 

In recent years, **safeguards policies** have been receiving considerable media attention as IFIs continue to invest time and resources in updating their safeguard policy frameworks. Yet safeguards are but one aspect of **social policy**.  Other aspects include **social development policy** (including initiatives to mainstream gender-sensitive development; initiatives to ensure the participation and empowerment of people and communities affected by development processes), **social protection policy** (including social assistance and welfare service programs including child protection and micro- and area based schemes to address poverty, and vulnerability; social insurance programs to cushion risks associated with unemployment, ill-health, disability, work-related injury and old age; and labour market policies and programs designed to generate employment, improve working conditions), **human rights law**, etc. Unfortunately, IFI institutional treatments of social issues (such as web and print publications touting institutional contributions to social development) seldom help to situate different institutional initiatives and activities within their greater policy contexts.

Adding an additional layer of complexity to any discussion of 'social policy' among international financial institutions (IFIs) are those policies that have an apparent 'social' orientation, but which are operational policies that come to bear only on internal bank operations.


----

**And also a short disclaimer:**

Please accept my work as on-going. I continue to struggle to account for what constitutes 'social policy' for a given lending institution.

Please also recognize that this list is not meant to be exhaustive; my focus is specific to social development concerns.

## Asian Development Bank

Investments of the Asian Development Bank must accord with the [ADB Charter](http://www.adb.org/documents/agreement-establishing-asian-development-bank-adb-charter) . Investment decisions are made in deference to internal strategies for reaching developmental targets, and their implementation is guided by [a series of operational policies](#adb-operational-policy). Client obligations to avoid and mitigate social and environmental risks are specified in the ADB's **[Safeguard Policy Statement](#adb-safeguards-policy)**.


<a name="adb-policy"></a>
### Policy

ADB regards policy as short, focused statements defining borrower client obligations that follow from [ADB's Charter](http://www.adb.org/documents/agreement-establishing-asian-development-bank-adb-charter "*Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank*, 1965"), [Asian Development Fund (ADF)](http://www.adb.org/site/adf/main) and [Regulations of Ordinary and Special Operations (OCR regulations)](http://www.adb.org/site/funds/ocr), as well as [other operational policies and strategies](http://www.adb.org/about/other-operational-policies-and-strategies) adopted by the [ADB Board of Directors](http://www.adb.org/about/board-directors).


<a name="adb-operational-policy"></a>
#### Operations Manual

The ADB [Operations Manual (OM)](http://www.adb.org/documents/operations-manual) collects operational policies known as [Bank Policies (BPs)]( "*bank policies*: short, focused statements defining borrower client obligations"). The OM also includes [Operational Procedures (OPs)]( "procedural requirements and guidance on policy implementation") that spell out procedural requirements and guidance on policy implementation (also referred to as **[policy operationalization]()**).


### Social Policy

It can be helpful to conceptualize Social policy at the ADB can be conceptually divided into two groups: 1) [safeguard policies](#adb-safeguards-policy), which seek to avoid, minimise, or mitigate adverse impacts of ADB operations <!-- one clause elaboration--> and 2) [development policies](#adb-development-policy), which articulate the ABD's aspirational notion of 'social development' and specify how these aims can be realized in practice.



<a name="adb-safeguards-policy"></a>
#### Safeguards Policy

The [safeguards policies of the Asian Development Bank](http://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/main) seek to avoid, minimise, or mitigate harmful environmental and social risks, impacts, and costs that may result from ADB-financed development initiatives.  The current ADB policy, set out in the 2009 *[Safeguard Policy Statement](http://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/policy-statement)* (SPS), defines safeguard principles and outlines implementation and delivery processes for safeguard policy compliance. The SPS builds upon (and supersedes) three previous safeguard policies: the (2002) *[Environment Policy](http://www.adb.org/documents/environment-policy-asian-development-bank)*, the 1998 *[Policy on Indigenous Peoples](http://www.adb.org/documents/policy-indigenous-peoples)*, and the 1995 *[Policy on Involuntary Resettlement](http://www.adb.org/documents/policy-involuntary-resettlement)*. The SPS  brings them into one single policy that enhances consistency and coherence, and more comprehensively addresses environmental and social impacts and risks. <sup>[ref1](http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement?ref=site/safeguards/publications "Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009. *Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS)*.

<a name="adb-development-policy"></a>
#### Development Policy

While safeguards policies are intended for risk avoidance, mitigation and management, other forms of social policy govern how the ADB investment in development initiatives. These 'development policies' define the ADB's aspirational notion of 'social development' and specify how these aims can be realized in practice.

*[Strategy 2020](http://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2020-working-asia-and-pacific-free-poverty)* is among the most recent examples of ADB development policy. *Strategy 2020* reaffirms ADB's vision of an Asia and Pacific free of poverty as well as its mission to help its developing member countries improve their living conditions and quality of life. To achieve these ends, *Strategy 2020* prioritizes three complementary development agendas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. To better ensure that it is achieving the goals of Strategy 2020, ADB also developed a [results framework](http://www.adb.org/site/development-effectiveness/adb-results-framework) to facilitate progress assessments and evaluation of strategy efficacy.

Earlier development policies of the Asian Development Bank that remain in effect are the 2003 *Policy on Gender and Development*  and the 2001 *Social Protection Strategy*.

The 2003 *[Policy on Gender and Development](http://www.adb.org/documents/policy-gender-and-development)* (GAD) seeks to mainstream awareness of gender issues in order to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment across all ADB operations&mdash;from country partnership strategies to the design and implementation of gender-inclusive projects and programs. The GAD policy is a stand-alone instrument and regarded by ADB as a necessary component for realizing sustained economic growth, faster poverty -reduction, and inclusive development. The GAD policy's relevance and approach were confirmed by the 2002 Interim Progress Report on the Policy on GAD and 2006 GAD Policy Implementation Review. Gender issues are also addressed ADB’s long-term strategic framework&mdash;Strategy 2020&mdash;as one of the five [drivers of change](). The results framework measures the Bank's performance with regard to gender issues relative to quantiative targets, which are [tracked and reported annually]().

The 2001 *[Social Protection Strategy](http://www.adb.org/documents/social-protection-strategy)* (SPS) is another such development policy framework.  The SPS establishes the meaning of 'social protection' wtih ADB operations as a set of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption/loss of income. Priority interventions under this framework are those supporting social assistance and welfare services, including child protection and micro- and area-based schemes for poverty and vulnerability rediction; social insurance programs to cushion risks associated with unemployment, ill-health, disability, work-related injury and old age; and labor market policies and programs designed to generate employment, improve working conditions.

## World Bank

References to 'the World Bank' are made as if it were a single international financial institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital programs.  Such references  usually decribe the works and practices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The World Bank Group is actaully a greater body consisting of:

1. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), established in 1945, which provides debt financing on the basis of sovereign guarantees.
1. the International Finance Corporation (IFC), established in 1956, which provides various forms of financing without sovereign guarantees, primarily to the private sector;
1. the International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, which provides concessional financing (interest-free loans or grants), usually with sovereign guarantees;
1. the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established in 1965, which works with governments to reduce investment risk;
1. the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established in 1988, which provides insurance against certain types of risk, including political risk, primarily to the private sector.


<!-- The agencies of the World Bank are each governed by their Articles of Agreement that serve as the legal and institutional foundation for all of their work.[7] -->
Each of the World Bank Group institutions operates according to procedures established by its [articles of agreement](http://go.worldbank.org/BA0GA6O820), or an equivalent governing document. These documents outline the conditions of membership and the general principles of organization, management, and operations. Each institution is run by a Board of Governors meeting once a year.[7] Each member country appoints a governor, generally its Minister of Finance. On a daily basis the World Bank Group is run by a Board of 25 Executive Directors to whom the governors have delegated certain powers. Each Director represents either one country (for the largest countries), or a group of countries. Executive Directors are appointed by their respective governments or the constituencies. [7]

<!-- The World Bank Institute is the capacity-development branch of the World Bank, providing learning and other capacity-building programs to member countries.  -->


<a name="world-bank-policy"></a> 
### Policy

The World Bank understands policy as a statement of broad substantive principles that require, permit or constrain Bank activities to achieve [institutional goals](http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/BODEXT/0,,contentMDK:50004943~pagePK:64020054~piPK:64020408~theSitePK:278036,00.html).

* Operational Policies (OPs): are short, focused statements of policy that are based on the Bank's Articles of Agreement, the General Conditions, and policies approved by the Bank’s Executive Directors. OPs set out the mandatory policy requirements for the conduct of Bank operations.
* Bank Procedures (BPs): are statements setting out the general mandatory procedural requirements necessary for Bank staff to carry out the policies set out in the OPs. They are designed to ensure Bankwide consistency and quality in Bank operations.
* Directive: a statement of substantive directions, within Management’s authority, that require, permit or constrain activities. If accompanied by a Policy, the statement provides substantive details (methods, criteria and technical information) on how to implement the Policy. The statement may also address matters not covered by a Policy.
* Operational Memoranda (OpMemos): are interim mandatory requirements designed to elaborate on requirements in OPs/BPs or to reflect changes to the OPs/BPs which have not yet been incorporated in the OPs/BPs concerned. Once the requirements in OpMemos are incorporated into revisions of the pertinent OPs/BPs, the Op Memos are retired.

[Social Development Policies](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialdevelopment/brief/social-development-policies)


<a name="world-bank-safeguards-policy"></a>
#### [Safeguards Policy](http://go.worldbank.org/WTA1ODE7T0)

The World Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies are a cornerstone of its support to sustainable poverty reduction. The objective of these policies is to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. These policies provide guidelines for bank and borrower staffs in the identification, preparation and implementation of programs and projects.

The effectiveness and development impact of projects and programs supported by the Bank has substantially increased as a result of attention to these policies.  Safeguard policies have often provided a platform for the participation of stakeholders in project design, and have been an important instrument for building ownership among local populations.

**Safeguards at Work**

For example, the Mumbai Urban Transport Project involved urban resettlement on an unparalleled scale, thus requiring compliance with the World Bank’s resettlement safeguard policy, among others.  Over 100,000 people living along roads and railway tracks were to be resettled to improve rail and road transport services.  Almost 95% of the affected people did not have legal title to the land they occupied. Affected structures included an assortment of residences, businesses, religious and community facilities, schools, dispensaries and nurseries.

The unprecedented scale and complexity of the process called for innovative solutions.  Recognizing people's concerns regarding involuntary resettlement, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) altered its approach from one that narrowly focused on compensating people for their losses towards one that sought to arrive at a ‘win-win' solution for all.  This resulted in wider consultation and negotiation with the affected people, with the help of NGOs.

The agency's willingness to adapt and explore alternative solutions, often surpassing the scope of its Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, enabled it to come up with innovative resettlement options that were more agreeable to the affected people. Going beyond the provision of brick and mortar resettlement sites, the MMRDA helped the resettled people to adapt to their new environments. Resettlement colonies were provided with schools, day-care centers, and women's centers. People's livelihood options were expanded through skills training for the youth and micro-credit for women.

An independent study has found that the provision of formal housing to resettled families has raised their social status and improved their employability and creditworthiness. It has also given them, especially the women, a greater sense of security in their new homes.

**Preparing for the Next Generation of Environmental and Social Protection**

The issues our clients face have changed dramatically over the last 20 years, and their ability to manage them – as well as the Bank’s - has significantly increased.  In late 2012, the World Bank launched a multi-phased process to review and update its environmental and social safeguard policies.

The multi-stage review, supported by several periods of global consultations with stakeholders, is being undertaken in response to the need to better address environmental and social issues that countries face today, to deliver better environmental and social outcomes in the projects and programs the Bank supports, to ensure treatment and coverage of environmental and social impacts and risks, to strengthen the ability to monitor and supervise actual impacts on people and the environment, and to better meet the varied needs of borrowers, and help strengthen country frameworks and institutions to deliver sustainable results on the ground.

The second phase of the review - consultations on a first draft of the proposed Environmental and Social Framework - closed on March 1, 2015.  The excellent stakeholder feedback we received is being compiled and reviewed, and the draft document will then be revised and shared again.

World Bank Performance Standards

On June 26, 2012, the Board of Executive Directors approved adoption and application of World Bank Performance Standards to be used for Bank financing or support (e.g., Partial Risk Guarantees) which is destined to projects, or components thereof, that are owned, constructed, and/or operated by the private sector, in place of the World Bank environmental and social Safeguard Policies (R2012-0130;IDA/R2012-0161).  Technical assistance for preparatory work for private sector engagement in PPPs would be eligible, as well as investment operations that include medium -or long-term management contracts, affermage/leases, privatizations, concessions, and projects within the Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) family.  Financial Intermediary lending also is a candidate, provided the Bank lending or guarantee to the financial intermediary is designated for subprojects implemented by the private sector or private parties.

#### Development Policy

A number of World Bank operational policies deal specifically with social development concerns. These include the social safeguard policies, aimed at minimizing the negative impact of Bank-funded operations on vulnerable groups (displaced populations and indigenous peoples). The Conflict and Development policy provides guidance on Bank assistance to conflict-affected countries. The Gender policy provides guidance on Bank assistance to member countries in their efforts to reduce poverty and enhance economic growth and human well-being by addressing gender disparities and inequalities. For more information on the Bank's operational policies, refer to the World Bank Operational Manual.

General Operational Policies
POLICIES are directives that define the general lines of action of the Bank with regard to operations, administration, and personnel.

OPERATIONAL POLICIES are general directives whose purpose is to regulate the assistance provided by the Bank to its borrowers, define development strategies, and provide a high-level guide for operational decisions. They are grouped as follows:

GENERAL OPERATIONAL POLICIES which regulate the terms and conditions that are common to all the Bank's operations.
FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL POLICIES which establish the sources of financing for loans, the purpose and use of each of the Bank's funds, and the terms and conditions for operations in each case.
SECTORAL OPERATIONAL POLICIES which contribute to the development of a specific branch of the economy and provide a strategic framework for programming the Bank's country and regional operations in that branch.
MULTISECTOR POLICIES which contribute to the development of more than one branch of the economy and are applicable to several fields of economic activity.
A POLICY PAPER is a report drawn up when a policy is being developed, which is submitted to the different bodies of the Bank for approval and authorization.
Content of a Policy

Depends, in principle, on the nature of the policy and should be expressed succinctly, clearly, and in concrete terms. A policy paper should include:

Background on the Bank's experience and action in the area, and information and analysis for a better understanding of the proposed policy and the grounds therefor.
The policy itself, including:
the purpose and principle of the policy;
a description of the objective(s) of the proposed policy;
field(s) of activity and priorities - chiefly applicable to sector policies;
criteria or basic guidelines to facilitate and clarify the application of the policy.
Operational policy manuals should contain the policies themselves and specify the original policy document approved by the Board of Executive Directors.

Responsibility

A MULTIDISCIPLINARY WORKING GROUP coordinated by the department with basic responsibility prepares proposals regarding the Bank's operational policies. DPP, SDS, and PRI, which are responsible for developing general operational policies, sector policies, and private-sector policies, respectively, are required to prepare the documentation, make the necessary adjustments to the drafts of each proposal, and present the policy paper to the Bank's review and approval bodies.

THE PROGRAMMING COMMITTEE reviews and comments on policy proposals and authorizes their submission to the Coordination Committee.

THE COORDINATION COMMITTEE discusses and approves the PROPOSAL operational policies and authorizes their submission to the Board of Executive Directors.

THE BOARD OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS approves operational policies.

Processing

The specific guidelines and procedures for processing operational policy documents are set out in the Secretariat Services Manual (SS).

Modifications

Any modifications to an operational policy that affect its nature, objectives, criteria, or basic guidelines must be approved by the Board of Executive Directors.

### Sustainability Framework

[IFC Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/sustainabilityframework)
 
The Sustainability Framework articulates IFC's strategic commitment to sustainable development and is an integral part of our approach to risk management.
 
Our Sustainability Framework helps our clients do business in a sustainable way. It promotes sound environmental and social practices, encourages transparency and accountability, and contributes to positive development impacts. IFC's Performance Standards, which are part of the Sustainability Framework, have become globally recognized as a benchmark for environmental and social risk management in the private sector.
 
Originally adopted in 2006, the Sustainability Framework has recently been updated following an 18-month consultation process with stakeholders around the world.
 
Effective on January 1, 2012, our updates reflect the evolution in good practice for sustainability and risk mitigation over the past five years. They incorporate modifications on challenging issues that are increasingly important to sustainable businesses, including supply-chain management, resource efficiency and climate change, and business and human rights.
 
The Sustainability Framework consists of
 
1. The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability, which defines IFC's commitments to environmental and social sustainability.
1. The Performance Standards, which define clients' responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks.
1. The Access to Information Policy, which articulates IFC's commitment to transparency.
 
Policies
 
The updated 2012 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to all investment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process after January 1, 2012.
The 2006 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to investments that go through IFC's initial credit review process from April 30, 2006 to December 31, 2011.
Investments made prior to April 30, 2006 are subject to the Safeguard Policies.
