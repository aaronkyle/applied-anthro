## Asian Development Bank

### Policy

Investments of the Asian Development Bank must accord with the ADB's mandate . Investment decisions are made in deference to internal strategies for reaching developmental targets--the implementation of which is guided by a few key **'operational policies'** and **'development policies'**.  Borrower clients must comply with ADB policy and regulatory frameworks for avoiding and mitigating social and environmental risks as specified by the ADB's **'safeguard policy frameworks'**.


#### Safeguards Policy

The safeguards policies of the Asian Development Bank seek to avoid, minimise, or mitigate harmful environmental and social risks, impacts, and costs that may result from ADB-financed development initiatives.  The current ADB policy, set out in the 2009 *[Safeguard Policy Statement](http://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/policy-statement)* (SPS), defines safeguard principles and outlines implemention and delivery processes for safeguard policy compliance. The SPS builds upon the three previous safeguard policies: the (2002) *[Environment Policy](http://www.adb.org/documents/environment-policy-asian-development-bank)*, the 1998 *[Policy on Indigenous Peoples](http://www.adb.org/documents/policy-indigenous-peoples)*, and the 1995 *[Policy on Involuntary Resettlement](http://www.adb.org/documents/policy-involuntary-resettlement)*. The SPS  brings them into one single policy that enhances consistency and coherence, and more comprehensively addresses environmental and social impacts and risks. [FN1](http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-statement?ref=site/safeguards/publications).

### Policy

### Sustainability Framework

[IFC Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/sustainabilityframework)
 
The Sustainability Framework articulates IFC's strategic commitment to sustainable development and is an integral part of our approach to risk management.
 
Our Sustainability Framework helps our clients do business in a sustainable way. It promotes sound environmental and social practices, encourages transparency and accountability, and contributes to positive development impacts. IFC's Performance Standards, which are part of the Sustainability Framework, have become globally recognized as a benchmark for environmental and social risk management in the private sector.
 
Originally adopted in 2006, the Sustainability Framework has recently been updated following an 18-month consultation process with stakeholders around the world.
 
Effective on January 1, 2012, our updates reflect the evolution in good practice for sustainability and risk mitigation over the past five years. They incorporate modifications on challenging issues that are increasingly important to sustainable businesses, including supply-chain management, resource efficiency and climate change, and business and human rights.
 
The Sustainability Framework consists of
 
The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability, which defines IFC's commitments to environmental and social sustainability.
The Performance Standards, which define clients' responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks.
The Access to Information Policy, which articulates IFC's commitment to transparency.
 
Policies
 
The updated 2012 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to all investment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process after January 1, 2012.
The 2006 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to investments that go through IFC's initial credit review process from April 30, 2006 to December 31, 2011.
Investments made prior to April 30, 2006 are subject to the Safeguard Policies.
