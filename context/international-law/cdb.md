### Convention on Biological Diversity [^CBD]

The 1992 *Convention on Biological Diversity* (CBD) is an international legally binding treaty.[^CBD-parties]

<!--
signed and ratified by the Government of Indonesia.
--> 

The Convention has three (3) main goals:

1) conservation of biological diversity;
2) sustainable use of its components;
3) fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.

---

Within the convention, the following passages relate to community consultation and participation:

#### Article 8:In-situ Conservation

Article 8(j) specifies that, subject to national legislation, party states must:

> “respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices”.

This article carries with it the implicit requirement that for projects affecting indigenous and local communities, such communities need to be consulted with and studied regarding their practices of biodiversity conservation. Indigenous participation is critical not only in regards to gathering this information, but also in terms of deciding equitable recompense for the benefits accrued from the utilization of indigenous knowledge.

#### Article 14:	Impact Assessment and Minimizing Adverse Impacts

Article 14(c) notes that parties to the convention must promote informed consultation on activities that are likely to cause significant adverse impacts on the biological diversity of other States, or areas beyond the limits of their own national jurisdiction. Such promotion may be achieved by encouraging the negotiation of bilateral, regional or multilateral arrangements. 

#### Decisions of the Conference of Parties

In addition to the CBD itself, the Decisions of the Conference of Parties (COP) must also be taken into account—intended as they are to determine the policy, strategy and program priorities within the framework of the COP. 

At the Fifth Conference of Parties, a Decision [^CBD-decision-v16] was adopted reiterating the necessity of the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the development of guidelines for benefits sharing. In addition, the Decision clearly states that women and women’s organization must be fully incorporated in the consultation process and given full access to participation. To achieve these aims, the Decision mandates that various mediums of communications should be used to most effectively reach, inform, and include the views and concerns of target indigenous populations. The Decision also states that Indigenous People should be engaged to develop a register of knowledge on traditional practices and lifestyles relevant to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and about ways to strengthen legislation, customary practices and traditional systems of resource management and methods of protecting their knowledge against unauthorized use. It requires that women’s knowledge be of conservation and methods of sustaining biological diversity be specially documented and preserved. Finally, the Decision of the Fifth Conference of Parties states that Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be consulted and encouraged to participate in the development of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding any development proposed to take place on sacred sites and on lands or waters occupied or used by indigenous and local communities. 

### Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination [^ICERD]

The United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) is a second-generation human rights instrument that commits its members to the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of understanding among all races. The Government of Indonesia acceded to this convention on 25 Jun 19995 (with the reservation that it does not consider itself bound by the provision of Article 22).

While the ICERD itself does not contain specific requirements on community consultation, it establishes the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination6, and empowers it to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly. This Committee’s guidelines do contain disclosure and consultation provisions.

#### Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination7

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Convention. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four (4)-year terms, with half the members elected every two (2) years. The CERD holds regular thematic discussions on issues related to racial discrimination and the Convention. The Committee then publishes its interpretation of the content of human rights provisions, in the form of general comments (referred to as ‘general recommendations’ in the practice of this committee) on thematic issues.

All parties are required to submit regular reports to the CERD outlining the legislative, judicial, and executive policies and other measures they have taken to give effect to the Convention. The first report is due within a year of the Convention entering into effect for that state; thereafter reports are due every two (2) years or whenever the Committee requests. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of ‘concluding observations’.

Based on, and in response to, the initial three (3) reports8 submitted by the Government of Indonesia (2000, 2002, and 2004), the CERD in 20079 made recommendations to amend Indonesia’s domestic laws, as the new regulations were designed to integrate the economic and social interests of Indigenous Peoples into the country’s overall modernization, economic, and social development plan. The aim of such reform and integration is recognition and respect of the important contributions of Indigenous People’s cultures to national identity. Indigenous Peoples should also be provided with the means for sustainable economic and social development. Consultation and cooperation with Indigenous Peoples is deemed necessary to achieve these goals.

The Committee also prescribes certain measures to ensure the protection and recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ communal land. Before the commencement of land development projects, the possession and ownership rights of local communities should be secured. This process should be based on meaningful consultation and should ensure the participation and consent of Indigenous Peoples.

Finally, the Committee strongly recommends efforts to prevent the resurgence of ethnic conflicts. The Committee recommends assessments of the adverse impact of the transmigration program—particularly on the rights of local communities—and encourages initiatives to promote mutual understanding between communities and mutual knowledge and respect for their histories, traditions and languages.


## Voluntary International Social Policy ‘Good Practice’ Frameworks


Following the recommendations of the International Finance Corporation10 the Project is committed to achieving internationally-recognized “good practice” disclosure frameworks for sustainability reporting. Toward this end, the Project will issue periodic ‘Sustainability Briefings’ that report on project performance relative to key sustainability indicators, as culled from a variety of recognized international standards: the Equator Principles, the UN Global Compact, ISO 26000, the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 11 and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).12 

This section provides an overview of the provisions of key international standards for achieving sustainable social and environmental development. More detailed information about these frameworks is provided in Annex 3: ‘Voluntary Sustainability Frameworks’.
