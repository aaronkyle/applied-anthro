IFIs produce a number of helpful informational resources to assit in project design and implementation.

This repository collects informational resources by financial institution.  Pages are also rendered in HTML for better viewing.  Althouhgh I rarely update the front end (making it far behind this repositry).

implementation-resources_adb.html
implementation-resources_adb.md

implementation-resources_world-bank.html
implementation-resources_world-bank.md

My early logic is separating out resources by institution for this link lists is that I am often interested in how an institution informs its staff to interpret or implement a policy.
