OPEN PIT MININ
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALIH GUIDELINES

Introduction

1. In open pit mining, accidents involve: handling materials, slips
or falls of persons, haulage and transport, machinery, falls of ground,
high voltage electricity, falling objects, use of inproper and defective
tools, acetylene and electric welding, and flying particles.

2. Surface mining is less hazardous than underground mining. Comparison
of accident rates in surface and underground metal mining in the
U.S. in 1970 shaws a work fatality frequency rate per million man-hours of
0.26 in surface mining against a figure of 0.96 for underground mining.
For non-fatal injuries the frequency rate was 12.65 for surface mines and
59.34 for underground mines (per million man-hours). The injury-severity
rate for surface mines was 2,313 days lost per million man-hours, conpared
to the corresponding rate of 8,107 for underground operations.

3. The main health hazard is exposure to excessive dust. Continued
exposure to excessive dust can lead to development of pneumoconiotic lung
diseases such as silicosis (from quartz), coal worker's pneumoconiosis
(from coal), asbestosis (from asbestos), talcosis (from talc), graphitosis
(from graphite) and liparosis (from pumice). Also, dust with high concentration
of various toxic metals can lead to metal intoxication. Other
health hazards include excessive noise from equipment and machinery, and
during blasting operations, as well as exposure to extreme weather conditions.

4. These guidelines will cover reconmendations on safety and health
in open pit mining to prevent and reduce accidents and occupational diseases
among enployees.

Safety

5. Most work injuries occur in the handling of materials. They
occur in the process of nanually moving, lifting, carrying, loading or
storing materials, supplies, ores and waste; unsafe work procedures and
faulty judgments are the principal causes of such injury-related accidents.

6. Other injuries result from slips and falls of persons, caused by
rough, uneven, cluttered or slippery working surfaces; from stumbling
hazards, and from poorly guarded or constructed elevated walkways or working
surfaces. Regular conpetent inspection of working areas to ensure
safely guarded high places, and good clean up or housekeeping procedures
will help to reduce or prevent these accidents. The workers should also be
trained in the proper work procedures and safety procedures.

7. Accidents involving the haulage and transport of ore, waste,
supplies, and men are prevalent and they cause a number of deaths and
permanent injuries. Measures to control these accidents include:
conpetent design of the haulage roadways, technical inspection and
maintenance of equipment as well as education of the worker in safe haulage
practices.

8. Accidents due to falls of ground or face can be prevented by
sealing down any loose material from the face. Control nust be maintained
on the wasted overburden to prevent large pieces from rolling down the
slopes of the piles.

9. The use and handling of explosives represents another potential
hazard. Only experienced workers-using safe working procedures--should
handle these materials.

10. Electrical equipment should be grounded and checked routinely for
defective insulation. All electrical installations and equipnent should be
in accordance with standards of the National Electrical Code. Inspection
of high-voltage electrical current lines and equipment should be made
before the men are allowed to work with and around high voltage
electricity.

11. All machinery should have guards over cutting edges and other
safety devices to protect the workers.

12. Miners should have personal safety equipment and be properly
trained in using this equipnent; this should include: safety helmet, eye
and ear protection, snug fitting gloves, safety toe shoes or boots, and
dust respirator.

Health
Dust
13. Rock dust is constantly released into the air in mining
operations such as drilling, blasting, shovelling, tipping and so on. Fine
particles in the respirable range of 0.5 to 5 jm are particularly dangerous
due to their ability to penetrate the lungs. Silicosis, a serious lung
disease, is a major hazard in mines where rocks contain a high level of
quartz or free silica. If >5% quartz is found the TLV should be adjusted
accordingly as set forth by the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Other types of dust can cause other lung
diseases such as coal worker's pneumoconiosis (coal), asbestosis
(asbestos), talcosis (talc), graphitosis (graphite), liparosis (pumice),
etc. In mines involved with metal ores, the dust may contain excessive
levels of toxic metals. Dust sanple should be analyzed and nonitored with
appropriate frequency to ensure that workers are not exposed beyond the
TLV's of the particular contaminant(s) set forth by the AOGIH.

Dust levels should not be allowed to become excessive. Good
housekeeping practices, including routinely cleaning up the excessive dust,
may help. It may be necessary to wet the dust during certain operations,
such as drilling. Provisions ust be made for excess water or flooding.
Dust prevention and suppression must be adopted if excess dust levels are a
problem.
Noise
14. Excessive noise can cause permanent hearing loss. Loud background
noise (90 dBA) dulls senses including visual acuity, and increases
accident rates. If the noise level around moving machinery and other
equipment is higher than 90 decibels, those working on or near the equipment
should be supplied with ear protection. Equipment, including drills,
should be designed to have law noise levels in order to reduce the problem.
Good maintenance of machinery and equipment will also help.
Sanitary Facilities and Requirements
15. Very good sanitary and washing facilities, including shcwer
accomTodations, should be provided. The worker should change from his work
clothes daily.
Medical Examinations
16. Pre-errployment and periodic medical examinations of all workers
are required. It is recommended that chest X-rays and pulmonary function
tests be included in these examinations.
Training and Education
17. The education and training of enplayees in good safety practice
is the responsibility of management. All enployees should have training
and instruction in: first aid, prcper use of all personal safety equipment
including the use of fire extinguishers; safe lifting practices; proper use
of all tools and equipment; and what to do in the case of serious accidents.
These training programs should be given on a regular basis.
Record Keeping
18. Management is required to keep records of all accidents and illnesses
which involved enployees in the mines. This information should be
made available to the World Bank. An evaluation of injury and health data
will assist the Bank to evaluate the effectiveness of its occupational
safety and health programs.
