|	1	|	n/a	|	This policy[1] contributes to the Bank's [2] mission of poverty reduction and sustainable development by ensuring that the development process fully respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	For all projects that are proposed for Bank financing and affect Indigenous Peoples, [3] the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation. [4]	|	Engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation.	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	The Bank provides project financing only where free, prior, and informed consultation results in broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples.[5]	|	 -	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	Such Bank-financed projects include measures to	|	 -	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	(a) avoid potentially adverse effects on the Indigenous Peoples’ communities; or	|	Avoid potentially adverse effects on the Indigenous Peoples’ communities.	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	(b) when avoidance is not feasible, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects.	|	When avoidance is not feasible, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects.	|		|																			
|	1	|	n/a	|	Bank-financed projects are also designed to ensure that the Indigenous Peoples receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender and intergenerationally inclusive.  	|	Ensure that the Indigenous Peoples receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender and intergenerationally inclusive.  	|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. 	|	 -	|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	These distinct circumstances expose Indigenous Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects, including loss of identity, culture, and customary livelihoods, as well as exposure to disease.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	Gender and intergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples also are complex.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	As social groups with identities that are often distinct from dominant groups in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among the most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	As a result, their economic, social, and legal status often limits their capacity to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other productive resources, and/or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit from development.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	2	|	n/a	|	At the same time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in sustainable development and that their rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.	|	 -	|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	3	|		|	Identification.	|		|		|																			
|	3	|	Identification	|	Because of the varied and changing contexts in which Indigenous Peoples live and because there is no universally accepted definition of “Indigenous Peoples,” this policy does not define the term.	|	 -	|		|																			
|	3	|	Identification	|	Indigenous Peoples may be referred to in different countries by such terms as "indigenous ethnic minorities," "aboriginals," "hill tribes," "minority nationalities," "scheduled tribes," or "tribal groups."	|	Be aware that many appelations may be used to describe "Indigenous Peoples" as the term understood in the context of Bank safeguards.	|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	4	|	Identification	|	For purposes of this policy, the term “Indigenous Peoples” is used in a generic sense to refer to a distinct, vulnerable, social and cultural group[6] possessing the following characteristics in varying degrees:	|	The World Bank category of "Indigenous Peoples" refers to any distinct, vulnerable, social and cultural group and conforms (in varying degrees) to the following characteristics:	|		|

|	4	|	Identification	|	A group that has lost "collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories in the project area"; (paragraph 4 (b)) because of forced severance remains eligible for coverage under this policy.[8]	|	A group that has lost "collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories in the project area"; because of forced severance remains eligible for coverage under this policy.	|		|																			
|	4	|	Identification	|	Ascertaining whether a particular group is considered as “Indigenous Peoples” for the purpose of this policy may require a technical judgment (see paragraph 8).	|	If uncertain about policy application, seek technical assistance.	|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	5	|		|	Use of Country Systems.	|		|		|																			
|	5	|	Use of Country Systems	|	The Bank may decide to use a country’s systems to address environmental and social safeguard issues in a Bank-financed project that affects Indigenous Peoples.	|	The Bank may decide to use a country’s systems to address environmental and social safeguard issues in a Bank-financed project that affects Indigenous Peoples.	|		|

|	11	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Consultation and Participation	|	The Bank pays particular attention to the social assessment and to the record and outcome of the free, prior, and informed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities as a basis for ascertaining whether there is such support.	|		|		|																			
|	11	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Consultation and Participation	|	The Bank does not proceed further with project processing if it is unable to ascertain that such support exists.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|		|		|	Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	12	|		|	Indigenous Peoples Plan.	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	On the basis of the social assessment and in consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities, the borrower prepares an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) that sets out the measures through which the borrower will ensure that	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	(a) Indigenous Peoples affected by the project receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits; and	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	(b) when potential adverse effects on Indigenous Peoples are identified, those adverse effects are avoided, minimized, mitigated, or compensated for (see Annex B for details).	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	The IPP is prepared in a flexible and pragmatic manner,12 and its level of detail varies depending on the specific project and the nature of effects to be addressed.	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	The borrower integrates the IPP into the project design. When Indigenous Peoples are the sole or the overwhelming majority of direct project beneficiaries, the elements of an IPP should be included in the overall project design, and a separate IPP is not required.	|		|		|																			
|	12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	In such cases, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) includes a brief summary of how the project complies with the policy, in particular the IPP requirements.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	13	|		|	Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework.	|		|		|																			
|	13	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Planing Framework	|	Some projects involve the preparation and implementation of annual investment programs or multiple subprojects.[13]	|		|		|																			
|	13	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Planing Framework	|	In such cases, and when the Bank’s screening indicates that Indigenous Peoples are likely to be present in, or have collective attachment to, the project area, but their presence or collective attachment cannot be determined until the programs or subprojects are identified, the borrower prepares an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF).	|		|		|																			
|	13	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Planing Framework	|	The IPPF provides for the screening and review of these programs or subprojects in a manner consistent with this policy (see Annex C for details).	|		|		|																			
|	13	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Planing Framework	|	The borrower integrates the IPPF into the project design.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	14	|		|	Preparation of Program and Subproject IPPs.	|		|		|																			
|	14	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Preparation of Program and Subproject IPPs	|	If the screening of an individual program or subproject identified in the IPPF indicates that Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have collective attachment to, the area of the program or subproject, the borrower ensures that, before the individual program or subproject is implemented, a social assessment is carried out and an IPP is prepared in accordance with the requirements of this policy.	|		|		|																			
|	14	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Preparation of Program and Subproject IPPs	|	The borrower provides each IPP to the Bank for review before the respective program or subproject is considered eligible for Bank financing.[14]  	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|

|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	15	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Disclosure	|	The borrower makes the social assessment report and draft IPP/IPPF available to the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities in an appropriate form, manner, and language.[15]	|		|		|																			
|	15	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Disclosure	|	Before project appraisal, the borrower sends the social assessment and draft IPP/IPPF to the Bank for review.[16]	|		|		|																			
|	15	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Disclosure	|	Once the Bank accepts the documents as providing an adequate basis for project appraisal, the Bank makes them available to the public in accordance with The World Bank Policy on Disclosure of Information, and the borrower makes them available to the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities in the same manner as the earlier draft documents. 	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|		|		|	Special Considerations	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|		|		|	Lands and Related Natural Resources	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	Indigenous Peoples are closely tied to land, forests, water, wildlife, and other natural resources, and therefore special considerations apply if the project affects such ties.	|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	In this situation, when carrying out the social assessment and preparing the IPP/IPPF, the borrower pays particular attention to:	|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(a)  the customary rights17 of the Indigenous Peoples, both individual and collective, pertaining to lands or territories that they traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied, and where access to natural resources is vital to the sustainability of their cultures and livelihoods; 	|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(b)  the need to protect such lands and resources against illegal intrusion or encroachment;	|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(c)  the cultural and spiritual values that the Indigenous Peoples attribute to such lands and resources; and	|		|		|																			
|	16	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(d)  Indigenous Peoples’ natural resources management practices and the long-term sustainability of such practices.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	If the project involves (a) activities that are contingent on establishing legally recognized rights to lands and territories that Indigenous Peoples have traditionally owned or customarily used or occupied (such as land titling projects), or (b) the acquisition of such lands, the IPP sets forth an action plan for the legal recognition of such ownership, occupation, or usage.	|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	Normally, the action plan is carried out before project implementation; in some cases, however, the action plan may need to be carried out concurrently with the project itself.	|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	Such legal recognition may take the following forms:	|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(a)  full legal recognition of existing customary land tenure systems of Indigenous Peoples; or 	|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	(b)  conversion of customary usage rights to communal and/or individual ownership rights.	|		|		|																			
|	17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	If neither option is possible under domestic law, the IPP includes measures for legal recognition of perpetual or long-term renewable custodial or use rights.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|		|		|	Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	If the project involves the commercial development of natural resources (such as minerals, hydrocarbon resources, forests, water, or hunting/fishing grounds) on lands or territories that Indigenous Peoples traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied, the borrower ensures that as part of the free, prior, and informed consultation process the affected communities are informed of	|		|		|																			
|	18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(a) their rights to such resources under statutory and customary law;	|		|		|																			
|	18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(b) the scope and nature of the proposed commercial development and the parties interested or involved in such development; and	|		|		|																			
|	18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(c) the potential effects of such development on the Indigenous Peoples’ livelihoods, environments, and use of such resources.	|		|		|																			
|	18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	The borrower includes in the IPP arrangements to enable the Indigenous Peoples to share equitably in the benefits[18] to be derived from such commercial development; at a minimum, the IPP arrangements must ensure that the Indigenous Peoples receive, in a culturally appropriate manner, benefits, compensation, and rights to due process at least equivalent to that to which any landowner with full legal title to the land would be entitled in the case of commercial development on their land.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	If the project involves the commercial development of Indigenous Peoples’ cultural resources and knowledge (for example, pharmacological or artistic), the borrower ensures that as part of the free, prior, and informed consultation process, the affected communities are informed of	|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(a) their rights to such resources under statutory and customary law;	|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(b) the scope and nature of the proposed commercial development and the parties interested or involved in such development; and	|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	(c) the potential effects of such development on Indigenous Peoples’ livelihoods, environments, and use of such resources.	|		|		|																			
|		|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|		|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	Commercial development of the cultural resources and knowledge of these Indigenous Peoples is conditional upon their prior agreement to such development.	|		|		|																			
|	19	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	The IPP reflects the nature and content of such agreements and includes arrangements to enable Indigenous Peoples to receive benefits in a culturally appropriate way and share equitably in the benefits to be derived from such commercial development.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|		|		|	Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	20	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	Because physical relocation of Indigenous Peoples is particularly complex and may have significant adverse impacts on their identity, culture, and customary livelihoods, the Bank requires the borrower to explore alternative project designs to avoid physical relocation of Indigenous Peoples.	|		|		|																			
|	20	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	In exceptional circumstances, when it is not feasible to avoid relocation, the borrower will not carry out such relocation without obtaining broad support for it from the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities as part of the free, prior, and informed consultation process.	|		|		|																			
|	20	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	In such cases, the borrower prepares a resettlement plan in accordance with the requirements of  OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement, that is compatible with the Indigenous Peoples’ cultural preferences, and includes a land-based resettlement strategy.	|		|		|																			
|	20	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	As part of the resettlement plan, the borrower documents the results of the consultation process.	|		|		|																			
|	20	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	Where possible, the resettlement plan should allow the affected Indigenous Peoples to return to the lands and territories they traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied, if the reasons for their relocation cease to exist.	|		|		|																			
|		|		|		|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	In many countries, the lands set aside as legally designated parks and protected areas may overlap with lands and territories that Indigenous Peoples traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied.	|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	The Bank recognizes the significance of these rights of ownership, occupation, or usage, as well as the need for long-term sustainable management of critical ecosystems.	|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	Therefore, involuntary restrictions on Indigenous Peoples’ access to legally designated parks and protected areas, in particular access to their sacred sites, should be avoided.	|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	In exceptional circumstances, where it is not feasible to avoid restricting access, the borrower prepares, with the free, prior, and informed consultation of the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities, a process framework in accordance with the provisions of  OP 4.12.	|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	The process framework provides guidelines for preparation, during project implementation, of an individual parks and protected areas’ management plan, and ensures that the Indigenous Peoples participate in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the management plan, and share equitably in the benefits of the parks and protected areas. 	|		|		|																			
|	21	|	Special Considerations > Physical Relocation of Indigenous Peoples	|	The management plan should give priority to collaborative arrangements that enable the Indigenous, as the custodians of the resources, to continue to use them in an ecologically sustainable manner.  	|		|		|

|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	In furtherance of the objectives of this policy, the Bank may, at a member country’s request, support the country in its development planning and poverty reduction strategies by providing financial assistance for a variety of initiatives designed to:	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(a)   strengthen local legislation, as needed, to establish legal recognition of the customary or traditional land tenure systems of Indigenous Peoples;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(b)   make the development process more inclusive of Indigenous Peoples by incorporating their perspectives in the design of development programs and poverty reduction strategies, and providing them with opportunities to benefit more fully from development programs through policy and legal reforms, capacity building, and free, prior, and informed consultation and participation;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(c)   support the development priorities of Indigenous Peoples through programs (such as community-driven development programs and locally managed social funds) developed by governments in cooperation with Indigenous Peoples;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(d)   address the gender19 and intergenerational issues that exist among many Indigenous Peoples, including the special needs of indigenous women, youth, and children;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(e)  prepare participatory profiles of Indigenous Peoples to document their culture, demographic structure, gender and intergenerational relations and social organization, institutions, production systems, religious beliefs, and resource use patterns;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(f)   strengthen the capacity of Indigenous Peoples’ communities and IPOs to prepare, implement, monitor, and evaluate development programs;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(g)  strengthen the capacity of government agencies responsible for providing development services to Indigenous Peoples;	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(h)   protect indigenous knowledge, including by strengthening intellectual property rights; and	|		|		|																			
|	22	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	(i)   facilitate partnerships among the government, IPOs, CSOs, and the private sector to promote Indigenous Peoples’ development programs. 	|		|		|

|		|		|	____________	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 1	|	n/a	|	This policy should be read together with other relevant Bank policies, including Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11), Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12), Forests (OP 4.36), and Safety of Dams (OP 4.37).	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 2	|	n/a	|	“Bank” includes IBRD and IDA; “loans” includes IBRD loans, IDA credits, IDA grants, IBRD and IDA guarantees, and Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advances, but does not include development policy loans, credits, or grants. For social aspects of development policy operations, see OP 8.60, Development Policy Lending, paragraph 10. The term “borrower” includes, wherever the context requires, the recipient of an IDA grant, the guarantor of an IBRD loan, and the project implementing agency, if it is different from the borrower.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 3	|	n/a	|	This policy applies to all components of the project that affect Indigenous Peoples, regardless of the source of financing.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 4	|	n/a	|	“Free, prior, and informed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities” refers to a culturally appropriate and collective decisionmaking process subsequent to meaningful and good faith consultation and informed participation regarding the preparation and implementation of the project. It does not constitute a veto right for individuals or groups (see paragraph 10).	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 5	|	n/a	|	For details on “broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples,” see paragraph 11.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 6	|	Identification	|	The policy does not set an a priori minimum numerical threshold since groups of Indigenous Peoples may be very small in number and their size may make them more vulnerable.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 7	|	Identification	|	“Collective attachment” means that for generations there has been a physical presence in and economic ties to lands and territories traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied, by the group concerned, including areas that hold special significance for it, such as sacred sites. “Collective attachment” also refers to the attachment of transhumant/nomadic groups to the territory they use on a seasonal or cyclical basis.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 8	|	Identification	|	“Forced severance” refers to loss of collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories occurring within the concerned group members’ lifetime because of conflict, government resettlement programs, dispossession from their lands, natural calamities, or incorporation of such territories into an urban area. For purposes of this policy, “urban area” normally means a city or a large town, and takes into account all of the following characteristics, no single one of which is definitive: (a) the legal designation of the area as urban under domestic law; (b) high population density; and (c) high proportion of nonagricultural economic activities relative to agricultural activities.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 9	|	Identification	|	The currently applicable Bank policy is OP/BP 4.00, Piloting the Use of Borrower Systems to Address Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-Supported Projects. Applicable only to pilot projects using borrower systems, the policy includes requirements that such systems be designed to meet the policy objectives and adhere to the operational principles related to Indigenous Peoples identified in OP 4.00 (see Table A1).	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 10	|	Project Preparation > Screening	|	The screening may be carried out independently or as part of a project environmental assessment (see OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment, paragraphs 3, 8).	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 11	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Consultation and Participation	|	Such consultation methods (including using indigenous languages, allowing time for consensus building, and selecting appropriate venues) facilitate the articulation by Indigenous Peoples of their views and preferences.  The Indigenous Peoples Guidebook (forthcoming) will provide good practice guidance on this and other matters.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 12	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Plan	|	When non-Indigenous Peoples live in the same area with Indigenous Peoples, the IPP should attempt to avoid creating unnecessary inequities for other poor and marginal social groups.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 13	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Indigenous Peoples Planing Framework	|	Such projects include community-driven development projects, social funds, sector investment operations, and financial intermediary loans.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 14	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Indigenous Peoples Plan/Planning Framework > Preparation of Program and Subproject IPPs	|	If the Bank considers the IPPF to be adequate for the purpose, however, the Bank may agree with the borrower that prior Bank review of the IPP is not needed. In such case, the Bank reviews the IPP and its implementation as part of supervision (see OP 13.05, Project Supervision) 	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 15	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Disclosure	|	The social assessment and IPP require wide dissemination among the affected Indigenous Peoples’ communities using culturally appropriate methods and locations. In the case of an IPPF, the document is disseminated using IPOs at the appropriate national, regional, or local levels to reach Indigenous Peoples who are likely to be affected by the project.  Where IPOs do not exist, the document may be disseminated using other CSOs as appropriate.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 16	|	Project Preparation > Social Assessment > Disclosure	|	An exception to the requirement that the IPP (or IPPF) be prepared as a condition of appraisal may be made with the approval of Bank management for projects meeting the requirements of OP 8.00, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies. In such cases, management’s approval stipulates a timetable and budget for preparation of the social assessment and IPP or of the IPPF.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 17	|	Special Considerations > Lands and Related Natural Resources	|	“Customary rights” to lands and resources refers to patterns of long-standing community land and resource usage in accordance with Indigenous Peoples’ customary laws, values, customs, and traditions, including seasonal or cyclical use, rather than formal legal title to land and resources issued by the State.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 18	|	Special Considerations > Commercial Development of Natural and Cultural Resources	|	The Indigenous Peoples Guidebook (forthcoming) will provide good practice guidance on this matter.	|		|		|																			
|	Footnote 19	|	Indigenous Peoples and Development	|	See OP/BP 4.20, Gender and Development.	|		|		|
