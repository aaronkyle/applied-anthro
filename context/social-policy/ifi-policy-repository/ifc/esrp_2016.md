## ESRP4.DIRECT INVESTMENTS: DISCLOSURE AND COMMITMENT

2.8 Public Interest and Comments during Disclosure: Environmental and social inquiries or comments raised during the IFC disclosure period should be addressed in accordance with Environmental and Social Review Procedures (ESRP) 5: Managing Non-Routine Events in Investment Projects (Rules and Tools - Rules).
…

2.12 Determination of ICP, FPIC, and BCS: In cases where clients are required to engage in a process of Informed Consultation and Participation (ICP), IFC determines whether there is Broad Community Support (BCS) for the business activity by Affected Communities. Broad Community Support is a collection of expressions by Affected Communities, through individuals or their recognized representatives, in support of the proposed business activity. There may be BCS even if some individuals or groups object to the business activity. The LESS will verify that the client has implemented an ICP process. Where assets are known, and the project development timing permits, IFC will disclose a summary of how it made its BCS determination with the ESRS. Where a BCS summary is not available prior to Board approval, the ESRS will be updated with this summary when available. Note that IFC will not routinely update ESRSs to summarise BCS in transactions that are corporate in nature with multiple sub-projects (for additional guidance please check the Guidance Note on “BCS Determination Pre-Board and Post-Board Supervision of ICP Process” in Rules & Tools/Mainstream/Board Review and Approval/Tools). The Manager CESI should be consulted, and the Director CES should be provided with the outcome of the BCS review. Where BCS is confirmed, the Director CES must clear the outcome. The FPIC/BCS process is summarized in the document entitled Review of Evidence of FPIC and BCS (see Rules and Tools – Appraisal Guidance) and then a FPIC/BCS approval memorandum is prepared by the LESS, and approved in writing by CES Director. This memorandum will be uploaded in iDesk.
After Board approval of the business activity, IFC continues to monitor the client’s ICP process as part of its portfolio supervision.
FPIC builds on and expands the process of ICP and will be established through good faith negotiation between the client and the Affected Communities of Indigenous Peoples. For additional guidance, refer to Rules and Tools/Appraisal for Mainstream Projects/ICP, BCS and FPIC Assessment and Approval Guidance, which also serves as accompanying guidance and support for E&S specialists.

2.13 Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) scope and content: The LESS is responsible for preparing and proposing reporting formats to the client to help IFC’s understanding of project E&S performance, compliance with ESAP, compliance with the applicable PS and general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines during the supervision phase. The AMR includes specific mandatory sections, ESAP Status, and any additional information that may be needed to evaluate client’s performance. Refer to AMR Generation Tools (see Rules and Tools).
The AMR scope and content and its required reporting frequency must be discussed and agreed with the client and with the Core Team Lawyer to ensure incorporation of requirements into the Investment Contract. Where feasible, IFC’s reporting requirements should take advantage of any other reporting by the client.
To support this requirement, the LESS shall:

• Prepare AMR reporting formats to ensure early on that the client is fully informed of the of data collection requirements necessary to support thorough and timely reporting; including ESAP Status reporting formats using the Action Plan Tracker Reports function and then transmit them to the iDesk Core Team leader for incorporation into the Investment Contract (generic term referring to Investment, Subscription, Participation, and other Agreements);
• Ensure that the Investment Contract mandates IFC client preparation and transmittal of AMR and clearly defines the frequency; and
• Ensure that the Investment Contract stipulates that the AMR may be changed by the client or by
IFC with mutual agreement because of changed project circumstances or to enhance the content,
clarity of E&S sustainability information reported to IFC.

2.14 Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) Input: The LESS will provide the investment department with selected DOTS E&S indicators for entry in the DOTS system under the Monitorable Impact Section. See Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) and Development Effectiveness at IFC (Rules and Tools - Guidance). The LESS should also review any commentary in the Board Paper on E&S Risks and Impacts, Additionality and Developmental Outcome. Where the project team proposes or the project is required to report against mandatory Development Outcome indicators, then the LESS should calculate baseline and target values for these and advise the investment team. 
2.16 E&S Input to Investment Contract and Core Team Lawyer Liaison: The LESS will continue the liaison with the iDesk Core Team Lawyer, review current iterations of the Investment Contract, and continue to provide E&S input for the drafting of legal agreements as needed. For those investments where non-standard E&S clauses are required the LESS will consult with the SL. For investments in market instruments and publically traded equity investments, where limited IFC influence or access to information exists because IFC cannot be a preferential shareholder, the LESS should seek alternative means of monitoring the investment such as through Corporate Sustainability or Social Responsibility Reports, etc. to monitor if the Company’s Environmental Management System is consistent with IFC’s PSs.

2.4 Special reporting requirements: in those circumstances when specific aspects of the project rise significant
E&S concerns IFC may request supplemental project information in addition to the AMR and on a quarterly
or even monthly basis depending on the nature of the issue and its potential E&S consequences. These
special reports will allow IFC to monitor more closely those specific aspects. In these cases additional
supervision site visits may be required too.

2.5 Recordable Supervision Activity , Supervised Projects, and Supervision Site Visits Plan:
2.5.1Recordable Supervision Activity (RSA): Is defined as any E&S specialist activity that results
in an assessment of a portfolio project’s E&S performance (e.g. obtaining and reviewing an
AMR; conducting a Supervision Site Visit; or participating in a client meeting, stakeholder meeting
or conference call) and an updated ESRR score. Written records of RSA activities are to be saved
in IFCDocs using the relevant supervision template.

2.5.2Client Meeting/Teleconference/Supplemental project information: could be alternative
supervision resources but they become RSA only if enough information is obtained to update
the client ESRR score. In such cases this supervision activity shall be recorded using the template
“Client Meeting/Information Review Summary” available in IFCDocs. If the information received
does not help to update the ESRR score, it can be saved as a stand-alone project document in
IFCDocs if warranted.

2.5.3Supervised Project: Is defined as a project for which the ESRR score, CRR language and
DOTS E&S ratings and indicators have been updated as a result of a Recordable Supervision
Activity. All active Category A and B investment projects should be supervised at least once a
year. 

2.5.4Supervision Site Visits (SSV) Plan: CESI RTLs are responsible for proposing a list of projects to
be supervised every year at the beginning of the fiscal year (FY) using Portfolio Considerations
below. RTLs will finalize the list of targeted projects for the FY following discussion with the
respective CESI Specialists, Industry Departments and CES Quality Assurance team and obtain
Manager CESI approval for the final SSV Plan. The Plan will constitute the annual target of
supervision site visits for that region and will be tracked on a regular basis.
Selection of projects for SSVs shall consider the following selection criteria

FY Supervision Site Visits(SSV),Recordable Supervision Activity (RSA) Selection Criteria

 Portfolio Consideration 

 SSV or Alternative RSA

  1. Knowledge Gap projects 
  • Mandatory SSV; 
  2. Projects with ESRR of 3 or 4 
  • Mandatory SSV; or 
  • If E&S Physical Supervision Detractors* apply, conduct alternative RSA with RTL approval; 3. All other projects • RSA; 
  • SSV Plans shall ensure consideration of the following: 
  Category A and high risk projects 
  Projects with complex ESAPs 
  Projects under construction 
  Projects within the first year of disbursement 

  *E&S Physical Supervision Detractors 

  Justification for removal of projects from the draft SSV Plan may include the following: 
  • Adequate Supervision Information is available from other sources - e.g. independent E&S monitoring reports, assessment reports from other lenders, etc.; 
  • Financial Restructuring underway; 
  • Constrained Engagement Projects: projects for which prospects of a resolution of issues with IFC are very low; and, where IFC leverage is limited; 
  • Excellent Sponsor E&S Capacity and Performance - RSA history confirms this; SSV would add no value (exclusively applicable to Portfolio Consideration 3 All Other Projects); 
  • Other compelling factors discussed and agreed between the LESS and the RTL.

Other factors may dictate SSV frequency, including major E&S incident(s), non-governmental organization (NGO) complaints, Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman Office investigations, an Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR), or an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) visit. Refer to ESRP 5: Managing Non-Routine Events in Investment Projects. If an SSV is proposed because of a circumstance described in ESRP 5, the LESS shall ensure consensus for mission travel among the RTL, TRL or Portfolio Officer, and Manager CESI.

2.6 PreparationforSupervisionSiteVisits:TheLESSshallprepareforandplantheSSVbyreviewing previous RSA records, appraisal-generated documents, including BTO reports, the Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS), the ESRD and ESAP. Additionally, the LESS shall review the client’s performance considering the requirements of the PSs, general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines, any environmental assessment mitigation and/or management plans and the criteria described for AMR reviews in Section 2.3 above. The LESS should ensure that the TRL or Portfolio Manager advises the client in advance of the proposed SSV, the purpose for the SSV, and recommended preparations. The SSV should include interview and discussion with the client and other representatives, document review, and physical inspection of selected facilities and/or activities.

Some IFC investments originally had a debt and an equity investment. Where the debt component is closed the E&S investment debt obligations are no longer applicable; however, if the company is not publically listed there may be E&S requirements tied to the equity investment. If the company is publically listed (refer to ESRP 4, 2.14) there may not be specific E&S requirements. In this case, the LESS should monitor the level of E&S risk posed for IFC. Ideally periodic reviews should be included in the Site Supervision Plan or other supervision formats whereby RSA should be used to evaluate project performance considering IFC’s at-Commitment E&S requirements (if any) and the applicable PSs.

Circumstances permitting, after completing the SSV, the LESS or their designee should have a close out meeting with the client including presentation of findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective actions. If ESAP items need to be altered or new ones added, the LESS should try to secure agreement with the client at this time.

2.7 Documenting the Supervision Site Visit: The LESS shall document the SSV, along with key observations and interpretations, findings, and conclusions, through completion of an SSV Findings (former BTO) or AMR Review and SSV Findings Combined format document created in IFCDocs (Rules and Tools - Document Formats). Using the Sponsor Follow-up section of the relevant template, the LESS will highlight any material E&S compliance gaps for the client’s attention. Once the document is completed, it must be filed in the Environmental Plans and Documents Folder of IFCDocs. CESI Specialists are responsible for distributing these reports, which contain the CRR E&S language, to the RTL and the Portfolio Officer along with the updated ESRR(S) (see Rules and Tools - Calculation and Estimation Tools). The LESS shall upload all other relevant E&S documents provided by the client to IFCDocs and will update the project’s DOTS record. Refer to Development Effectiveness at IFC (see Rules and Tools - Guidance).

2.8 Independent supervision activities: When several lenders are financing large and/or complex projects they often agree on hiring E&S consultants to conduct independent supervision activities on their behalf. These consultants regularly visit the project in order to supervise the project’s E&S performance and the progress on implementing the ESAP and they report back to the lenders. Thereafter, lenders follow up on any outstanding issues with the client as necessary. The LESS can rely on this source of supervision information to fulfill his responsibilities in terms of completing IFC’s records and databases (e.g. ESRD, ESAP Tracker, ESRS(S), CES HRL, IFCDocs supervision records, etc).

2.9 Waiving SupervisionSiteVisits: Itmay notbe feasible to conduct an SSVforprojectsselected in accordance with Portfolio Considerations in the FY Supervision Site Visits (SSV), Recordable Supervision Activity (RSA) Selection Criteria table above. In the case of projects listed in the Knowledge Gap, cancelling a planned supervision site visit requires the Manager CESI to be advised why supervision is not feasible using the Waiver of Environmental and Social Supervision and Removal from Knowledge Gap and Supervision Lists petition format (refer to Annex 7 and Rules and Tools - Document Formats). Supervision visits to projects that are not listed in the Knowledge Gap can be cancelled without a formal waiver but in order to reach the site supervision target they should be replaced with an alternative project supervision site visit.

2.9.1 Justifications for Waiving SSVs May Include:

* In the case of a dispute considered temporary and resolvable by the TRL/Portfolio Manager, the project supervision may be considered for postponement;
* In the case of a dispute considered permanent or irresolvable, an SSV may be postponed, suspended, or terminated; and
* Staff security and safety considerations.

2.9.2 Management Approval for SSV Waivers:

* The LESS will complete a Waiver of Environmental and Social Supervision and Removal from Knowledge Gap and Supervision Lists petition format (see Annex 7 and Rules and Tools - Document Formats) describing the reason for the proposed supervision waiver;
*  Obtain signature approval from the Manager CESI;
* Upload signed waiver to iDocs;
* Transmit approved waiver to Quality Assurance and to TRL;
* Quality Assurance will remove the project from current Fiscal Year Supervision Plan.

2.10 Update Status of ESAP Tasksin theAction Plan Tracker: The 2012 AIP mandates update of the implementation status (e.g. % Complete, Completed, Rescheduled, Cancelled, etc.) of the publicly disclosed ESAP once the project is in IFC’s portfolio for projects that were Board approved after January 1, 2012. The Action Plan Tracker maintains detailed information about ESAP Items status. When the status of all Items (Tasks) in the ESAP has been updated and Submitted, the information may then be published to the IFC Disclosure Website. The LESS selects the Supervision Disclosure option. The system then provides an illustration of the information that will be transmitted to the IFC Disclosure Website.
2.11 Unfulfilled Action Plan: If the client fails to comply with its E&S commitments expressed in the ESAP or legal agreements with IFC, the LESS shall work with the client to bring it back into compliance to the extent feasible and, if the client continues to fail to achieve compliance, shall recommend appropriate remedies for CESI Manager and Investment Department consideration. The project may be listed in the CES High Risk List because of the failure to implement the ESAP.

…

2.14 Update DOTS Indicators and DOTS Rating: Measuring development results helps IFC to report on our performance to stakeholders. Please refer to the Development Impact at IFC Website (see Rules and Tools – Mainstream Supervision – DOTS Guidance). The DOTS system (Development Outcome Tracking System) uses standard indicators for E&S that are aggregated into results to capture development impact and to facilitate comparison of development effectiveness across regions and industries. To update the status of each project the LESS may access the DOTS View tab in iDesk. Within the menu of DOTS E&S indicators there is a subset named as “CORE” E&S indicators. These indicators are the only ones the LESS is responsible for updating. Other indicators in the E&S menu (without the CORE name on it) are mostly related to CBG projects and are the responsibility of the Portfolio officer. A list of CORE E&S Indicators indicating which ones are mandatory by sector, and those that are subject to public disclosure and detailed definitions for each are located in Rules and Tools (Rules and Tools – Mainstream Supervision – DOTS Guidance). The CORE indicators are mandatory for some defined industry sectors and may not be eliminated without permission from the DEU Department. The LESS is responsible for updating the DOTS E&S Indicators that were established at appraisal; and, updating the DOTS Rating (Environmental and Social Performance) for each portfolio investment project on an annual basis. DOTS updates are required as a part of Recordable Supervision Activities.
2.15 The Expanded Project Supervision Report: The Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR) is an annual exercise by the Internal Evaluation Group (IEG) affecting a random sample of IFC projects 5 years after Commitment. The XPSR considers IFC and project performance, anticipated and actual project outcomes, and a review of the quality of IFC appraisal and supervision work. The LESS prepares for the XPSR by reviewing XPSR instructions and reporting template available on IEG’s Intranet site (refer to Expanded Project Supervision Report (XPSR) (see Rules and Tools - Guidance). The specialist should review available historical project records including IDocs and the M/Environment Files/Mainstream Projects drive and iDocs. Based upon this review, the LESS shall assess the project’s long-term E&S performance, including its E&S impacts and mitigation measures; compliance with PS, general and sector-specific EHS Guidelines, and ESAP requirements; client staff responsiveness; and the quality and frequency of the project’s E&S reporting. The LESS will schedule a Supervision Site Visit if necessary to assemble complete, up-to-date project information. After the SSV the LESS will provide input to the project team as needed, recording all key findings, decisions, analysis, and conclusions in the SSV Findings format created and stored in iDesk (see Rules and Tools - Document Formats). The LESS is responsible for distributing the report from iDesk. The LESS will record conclusions of the E&S project review in Project Environmental and Social (E&S) Review (See Rules and Tools – XPSR Guidance) and in the IEG XPSR report template (Expanded Project Supervision Report) (see Rules and Tools – XPSR Guidance); request review and approval from the CESI SL and/or RTL; and, when approved, send the completed XPSR report template to the Portfolio Officer. The LESS will upload the completed XPSR input to IFCDocs.
