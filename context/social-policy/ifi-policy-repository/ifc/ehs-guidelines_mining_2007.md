Occupational Guidelines

13. Occupational guidelines given in the following table are extracted
fram Occupational Safety and Health Administration (US Department of
Labor) and fran the booklet "'TLV" published by the American Conference on
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (1977). As discussed earlier, entries
in this table are TLV values for 8-hours exposure. Actually, any facility
should be designed and cperated to give levels well below these values (no
more than one-half the TLV is recommrended).

14. When figures are presented in millions of particles per cubic
foot (mIppf) they were determined by measurements on impinger samples
counted by light field techniques.

9. Quarrying and mining operations can discharge dust or particulate
matter into the atmosphere, as can plants producing steel, cement, and fertilizers.
While dusts may create environmental problems, it is important
to note that they may also create serious occupational hazards if the work
place has been poorly designed or is not properly operated. The human
health problem is of primary importance in these situations.

WORLD BANK ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
MINING AND MILLING - OPEN PIT

TAILINGS DISPOSAL

Tailings must be disposed of in a manner that optimizes protection of human safety and the environment. On-land
tailings impoundment systems must be designed and constructed in accordance with internationally recognized
engineering practices, local seismic conditions, and precipitation conditions. On-land disposal systems should be
designed to isolate acid leachate-generating material from oxidation or percolating water. Marine discharges of
tailings must not have a significant adverse effect on coastal resources. Riverine discharges are not acceptable
unless the project sponsor provides thorough documentation regarding: 1) environmental analysis of alternatives,
and 2) effects on aquatic resources and downstream users of riverine resources.

If the mining operation involves a series of open pit operations, project sponsors must evaluate the feasibility of
using abandoned open pits for tailings disposal.

LIQUID EFFLUENTS

The following are guidelines for effluent discharged to receiving waters from tailings impoundments, mine
drainage, sedimentation basins, sewage systems, and stormwater drainage. They do not apply to direct discharge of
tailings to the marine environment.

pH 6 to 9
BOD5 50 mg/l
Oil and Grease 20 mg/l
Total Suspended Solids 50 mg/l
Temperature - at the edge of Max 5° C above ambient temperature
a designated mixing zone of receiving waters - max 3° C if
 receiving waters >28° C
 
Residual Heavy Metals

The following are recommended target guidelines below which there is expected to be no risk for significant
adverse impact on aquatic biota or human use. In cases where natural background concentrations exceed these
levels, the discharge may contain concentrations up to natural background levels. Concentrations up to 110% of
natural background can be accepted if no significant adverse impact can be demonstrated.

Arsenic 1.0 mg/l
Cadmium 0.1 mg/l
Chromium, Hexavalent 0.05 mg/l
Chromium, Total 1.0 mg/l
Copper 0.3 mg/l
Iron, Total 2 mg/l
Lead 0.6 mg/l
Mercury 0.002 mg/l
Nickel 0.5 mg/l
Zinc 1.0 mg/l
Cyanide 

Source: The World Bank policies and guidelines, supplemented with information from OECD sources and the
proposed revisions to the World Bank guidelines.

The following are recommended target guidelines for discharges below which there is expected to be no risk for
significant adverse impact on aquatic biota or human use. In no case should the concentration in the receiving
water outside of a designated mixing zone exceed 0.022 mg/l.

Free Cyanide 0.1 mg/l
Total Cyanide 1.0 mg/l
Weak Acid Dissociable 0.5 mg/l

Measures to prevent access by wildlife and livestock are required for all open waters (examples tailings
impoundments and pregnant leach ponds) where WAD cyanide is in excess of 50 mg/l.

AMBIENT AIR

Concentrations of contaminants, measured outside the project property boundary, should not exceed the following
limits:

Particulate Matter (<10 µm)
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 500 µg/m3
Nitrogen Oxides, as NO2
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 200 µg/m3
Sulfur Dioxide
Annual Arithmetic Mean 100 µg/m3
Maximum 24-hour Average 500 µg/m3

Erosion and Sediment Control Plan

Project sponsors are required to prepare and implement an erosion and sediment control plan. The plan should
include measures appropriate to the situation to intercept, divert, or otherwise reduce the stormwater runoff from
exposed soil surfaces, tailings dams, and waste rock dumps. Project sponsors are encouraged to integrate vegetative
and non-vegetative soil stabilization measures in the erosion control plan. Sediment control structures (e.g.,
detention/retention basins) should be installed to treat surface runoff prior to discharge to surface water bodies. All
erosion control and sediment containment facilities must receive proper maintenance during their design life.

Mine Reclamation Plan

Project sponsors are required to prepare and implement a mine reclamation plan. The plan should include
reclamation of tailings deposits, any open pit areas, sedimentation basins, and abandoned mine, mill, and camp sites.

 The main objectives of the mine reclamation plan are:
 
a) return the land to conditions capable of supporting prior land use or uses that are equal to or better than prior
land use, to the extent practical and feasible
b) eliminate significant adverse effects on adjacent water resources.

Mine reclamation plans should incorporate the following components:

a) conserve, stockpile, and use topsoil for reclamation
b) slopes of more than 30% should be recontoured to minimize erosion and runoff
c) native vegetation should be planted to prevent erosion and encourage self-sustaining development of a

Project sponsors are encouraged to recycle or reclaim materials where possible. If recycling or reclaim is not
practical, these wastes must be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way in compliance with local laws and
regulations. Solvents and similar hazardous materials must not be disposed of in a manner likely to result in soil or
groundwater contamination if groundwater is potentially useable for potable water or irrigation purposes. Waste
rock dumps should be designed and engineered so that materials with high potential to generate acid leachate are
isolated from oxidation or percolating water.

b) Adequate ventilation must be provided before entry and during occupancy of these spaces.
c) Personnel must use air-supplied respirators when working in confined spaces which may become contaminated
or deficient in oxygen during the period of occupancy.
d) Observers/assistants must be stationed outside of confined spaces to provide emergency assistance, if
necessary, to personnel working inside these areas. 

HAZARDOUS MATERIAL HANDLING AND STORAGE

Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines
MINING 

Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines
for Mining



Introduction
The Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines
*
 are
technical reference documents with general and industryspecific
examples of Good International Industry Practice
(GIIP)1. When one or more members of the World Bank Group
are involved in a project, these EHS Guidelines are applied as
required by their respective policies and standards. These
industry sector EHS guidelines are designed to be used
together with the General EHS Guidelines document, which
provides guidance to users on common EHS issues potentially
applicable to all industry sectors. For complex projects, use of
multiple industry-sector guidelines may be necessary. A
complete list of industry-sector guidelines can be found at:
www.ifc.org/ifcext/enviro.nsf/Content/EnvironmentalGuidelines
The EHS Guidelines contain the performance levels and
measures that are generally considered to be achievable in new
facilities by existing technology at reasonable costs. Application
of the EHS Guidelines to existing facilities may involve the
establishment of site-specific targets, with an appropriate
timetable for achieving them.
The applicability of the EHS Guidelines should be tailored to the
hazards and risks established for each project on the basis of
the results of an environmental assessment in which site-

specific variables, such as host country context, assimilative
capacity of the environment, and other project factors, are taken
into account. The applicability of specific technical
recommendations should be based on the professional opinion
of qualified and experienced persons. When host country
regulations differ from the levels and measures presented in the
EHS Guidelines, projects are expected to achieve whichever is
more stringent. If less stringent levels or measures than those
provided in these EHS Guidelines are appropriate, in view of
specific project circumstances, a full and detailed justification for
any proposed alternatives is needed as part of the site-specific
environmental assessment. This justification should
demonstrate that the choice for any alternate performance
levels is protective of human health and the environment.
Applicability
The EHS Guidelines for Mining are applicable to underground
and open-pit mining, alluvial mining, solution mining, and marine
dredging. Extraction of raw materials for construction products
are addressed in the EHS Guidelines for Construction Materials
Extraction.
This document is organized according to the following sections:
Section 1.0 — Industry-Specific Impacts and Management
Section 2.0 — Performance Indicators and Monitoring
Section 3.0 — References and Additional Sources
Annex A — General Description of Industry Activities

1 Defined as the exercise of professional skill, diligence, prudence and foresight
that would be reasonably expected from skilled and experienced professionals
engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar
circumstances globally. The circumstances that skilled and experienced
professionals may find when evaluating the range of pollution prevention and
control techniques available to a project may include, but are not limited to,
varying levels of environmental degradation and environmental assimilative
capacity as well as varying levels of financial and technical feasibility.



1.0 Industry-Specific Impacts
and Management
The following section provides a summary of EHS issues
associated with mining activities (and including ore processing
facilities) which may occur during the exploration, development
and construction, operation, closure and decommissioning, and
post-closure phases, along with recommendations for their
management. Recommendations for the management of EHS
issues common to most large industrial activities are provided in
the General EHS Guidelines.
1.1 Environmental
Potential environmental issues associated with mining activities
may include management of the following:
· Water use and quality
· Wastes
· Hazardous materials
· Land use and biodiversity
· Air quality
· Noise and vibrations
· Energy Use
· Visual Impacts
Water Use and Quality
Management of water use and quality , in and around mine sites,
can be a significant issue. Potential contamination of water
sources may occur early in the mine cycle during the exploration
stage and many factors including indirect impacts (e.g.
population in-migration) can result in negative impacts to water
quality. Reduction of surface and groundwater availability is also
a concern at the local level and for communities in the vicinity of
mining sites, particularly, in arid regions, or in regions of high
agricultural potential. Mining activities should therefore include

adequate monitoring and managementof water use, in addition
to treatment of effluent streams including stormwater run-off
from the mine property.
Water Use
Mines can use large quantities of water, mostly in processing
plants and related activities, but also in dust suppression among
other uses. Water is lost through evaporation in the final product
but the highest losses are usually into the tailings stream. All
mines should focus on appropriate management of their water
balance. Mines with issues of excess water supply, such as in
moist tropical environments or areas with snow and ice melt,
can experience peak flows which require careful management.
Recommended practices for water management include:
· Establishing a water balance (including probable climatic
events) for the mine and related process plant circuit and
use this to inform infrastructure design;
· Developing a Sustainable Water Supply Management Plan
to minimize impact to natural systems by managing water
use, avoiding depletion of aquifers, and minimizing
impacts to water users;
· Minimizing the amount of make-up water;
· Consider reuse, recycling, and treatment of process water
where feasible (e.g. return of supernatant from tailings
pond to process plant);
· Consider the potential impact to the water balance prior to
commencing any dewatering activities;
· Consultation with key stakeholders (e.g. government, civil
society, and potentially affected communities) to
understand any conflicting water use demands and the
communities’ dependency on water resources and/or
conservation requirements that may exist in the area. 


Water Quality
Recommended practices to manage impacts to water quality
include:
· The quality and quantity of mine effluent streams
discharged to the environment, including stormwater, leach
pad drainage, process effluents, and overall mine works
drainage should be managed and treated to meet the
applicable effluent discharge guideline values in Section
2.0;
· In addition, discharges to surface water should not result in
contaminant concentrations in excess of local ambient
water quality criteria outside a scientifically established
mixing zone. Receiving water-body use and assimilative
capacity, including the impact of other sources of
discharges to the receiving water, should be considered
with respect to acceptable contaminant loadings and
effluent discharge quality as described in the General EHS
Guidelines;
· Efficient oil and grease traps or sumps should be installed
and maintained at refueling facilities, workshops, fuel
storage depots, and containment areas, and spill kits
should be available with emergency response plans;
· Water quality in open storage systems (e.g. leachate
areas, solution ponds, and tailings ponds or
impoundments) should be based on the results of a sitespecific
risk assessment with appropriate control measures
put in place to mitigate the risk or meet the effluent
guideline values in Section 2.0,
· Sanitary wastewater should be managed via reuse or
routing into septic or surface treatment as described in the
General EHS Guidelines. 

Stormwater
Key issues associated with management of stormwater include
separation of clean and dirty water, minimizing run-off, avoiding
erosion of exposed ground surfaces, avoiding sedimentation of
drainage systems and minimizing exposure of polluted areas to
stormwater. Recommended stormwater management strategies
have been broadly categorized into phases of operation
(although several measures span more than one phase
including the decommissioning and closure phase). As such;
From exploration onwards, management strategies include:
· Reducing exposure of sediment-generating materials to
wind or water (e.g. proper placement of soil and rock piles);
· Divert run-off from undisturbed areas around disturbed
areas including areas that have been graded, seeded, or
planted. Such drainage should be treated for sediment
removal;
· Reducing or preventing off-site sediment transport (e.g.
use of settlement ponds, silt fences);
· Stormwater drains, ditches, and stream channels should be
protected against erosion through a combination of
adequate dimensions, slope limitation techniques, and use
of rip-rap and lining. Temporary drainage installations
should be designed, constructed, and maintained for
recurrence periods of at least a 25-year/24-hour event,
while permanent drainage installations should be designed
for a 100-year/24-hour recurrence period. Design
requirements for temporary drainage structures should
additionally be defined on a risk basis considering the
intended life of diversion structures, as well as the
recurrence interval of any structures that drain into them.
From construction onwards, recommended management
strategies include:


· Establishing riparian zones;
· Timely implementation of an appropriate combination of
contouring techniques, terracing, slope reduction /
minimization, runoff velocity limitation and appropriate
drainage installations to reduce erosion in both active and
inactive areas;
· Access and haul roads should have gradients or surface
treatment to limit erosion, and road drainage systems
should be provided;
· Facilities should be designed for the full hydraulic load,
including contributions from upstream catchments and nonmined
areas;
· Stormwater settling facilities should be designed and
maintained according to internationally accepted good
engineering practices, including provisions for capturing of
debris and floating matter. Sediment control facilities
should be designed and operated for a final Total
Suspended Solids (TSS) discharge of 50 mg/l and other
applicable parameters and guideline values in Section 2.0,
taking into consideration background conditions and
opportunities for overall improvement of the receiving water
body quality, as discussed in the General EHS
Guidelines. Discharge water quality should also be
consistent with the receiving water body use.
From operations onwards, recommended management
strategies include:
· Final grading of disturbed areas, including preparation of
overburden before application of the final layers of growth
medium, should be along the contour as far as can be
achieved in a safe and practical manner;
· Revegetation of disturbed areas including seeding should
be performed immediately following application of the
growth medium to avoid erosion.


Acid Rock Drainage and Metals Leaching
Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) refers to acid formation that occurs
when Potentially Acid Generating (PAG) materials with acid
generating sulfide minerals in excess of acid neutralizing
minerals, principally carbonates, oxidize in an environment
containing oxygen and water. Acidic conditions tend to dissolve
and release metals from their matrices (a phenomenon known
as Metals Leaching or “ML”) which then may be mobilized in
surface and groundwater systems. ARD and ML should be
prevented and controlled as described in the ‘Solid Waste ’
section of this document. Management of PAG, ARD and ML
should extend for as long as there is a need to maintain effluent
quality to the levels required to protect the local environment,
including where necessary, into the decommissioning, closure,
and post-closure phases of the mine.
The ARD and ML issues apply to waste rock, tailing materials
and any exposed rock surfaces such as road cuts and pit walls.
Groundwater Resource Protection
In addition to the prevention and control of effluents, wastes,
and potential releases of hazardous materials, additional
recommendations for the management of potential sources of
groundwater contamination, primarily associated with leaching
and solution mining activities as well as tailings management
include the following:2

2 Additional information on groundwater protection measures in in-situ leaching
and solution mining activities can be found at USEPA Guidance available at:
http://www.epa.gov/safewater/uic/classv/pdfs/sol-fact.pdf;
http://www.uic.com.au/nip40.htm; and http://www.saltinstitute.org/12.html.


Leaching: Operators should design and operate surface heap
leach processes with:
· Infiltration of toxic leach solutions should be prevented
through the provision of appropriate liners and sub-

drainage systems to collect or recycle solution for
treatment, and minimize ground infiltration;
· Pipeline systems carrying pregnant solutions should be
designed with secondary bunded containment;
· Leak detection equipment should be installed for pipeline
and plant systems with appropriate leak response systems
in place;
· Process solution storage ponds and other impoundments
designed to hold non-fresh water or non-treated leach
process effluents should be lined, and be equipped with
sufficient wells to enable monitoring of water levels and
quality.
Solution Mining: Operators should design and operate solution
mining projects with consideration of the following:
· Proper location and operating practices based on the
characteristics of the confining strata, to ensure the
movement of leaching solution is minimized beyond the
extraction area and off-site aquifers are protected;
· Sufficient monitoring wells should be installed around
cavities to enable monitoring of pressure levels, as well as
water quantity and quality.
Wastes
Mines generate large volumes of waste. Structures such as
waste dumps, tailing impoundments / dams, and containment
facilities should be planned, designed, and operated such that
geotechnical risks and environmental impacts are appropriately
assessed and managed throughout the entire mine cycle.
Solid wastes may be generated in any phase of the mine cycle.
The most significant waste generating mining activities will likely
occur during the operational phases, which require the
movement of large amounts overburden and creation of rock 

waste and tailings. Other types of solid wastes, depending on
the type of mining undertaken, may include leach pad waste,
workshop scrap, household and non-process-related industrial
waste, as wells as waste oils, chemicals, and other potentially
hazardous wastes.
Waste Rock Dumps
Depending on the stripping ratio (in open pit mines), large
quantities of overburden or waste rock often need to be
removed to expose the mineral to be mined. The overburden
and waste rock is often disposed of in constructed waste rock
dumps. Management of these dumps during the mine life cycle
is important to protect human health, safety and the
environment.
Recommendations for management of waste rock dumps
include the following:
· Dumps should be planned with appropriate terrace and lift
height specifications based on the nature of the material
and local geotechnical considerations to minimize erosion
and reduce safety risks;
· Management of Potentially Acid Generating (PAG) wastes
should be undertaken as described in the guidance below;
· Potential change of geotechnical properties in dumps due
to chemical or biologically catalyzed weathering should be
considered. This can reduce the dumped spoils
significantly in grain size and mineralogy, resulting in high
ratios of clay fraction and a significantly decreased stability
towards geotechnical failure. These changes in
geotechnical properties (notably cohesion, internal angle of
friction) apply especially to facilities which are not
decommissioned with a proper cover system, which would
prevent precipitation from percolating into the dump’s body.
Design of new facilities has to provide for such potential
deterioration of geotechnical properties with higher factors 


of safety. Stability / safety assessments of existing facilities
should take these potential changes into account.
Tailings
Tailings management strategies vary according to site
constraints and the nature / type of the tailings. Potential
environmental impacts may include groundwater and surface
water contamination due to the generation of acid rock drainage
(ARD) and metals leaching (ML) containing runoff / leachate,
sedimentation of drainage networks, dust generation and the
creation of potential geotechnical hazards associated with the
selected management option. Tailings management strategies
should consider how tailings will be handled and disposed of
during operation, in addition to permanent storage after
decommissioning. Strategies should consider the site
topography, downstream receptors and the physical nature of
tailings (e.g. projected volume, grain size distribution, density,
water content, among other issues). 3
Recommended tailings management strategies include:
· Design, operation, and maintenance of structures
according to specifications of ICOLD3 and ANCOLD4, or
other internationally recognized standards based on a risk
assessment strategy. Appropriate independent review
should be undertaken at design and construction stages
with ongoing monitoring of both the physical structure and
water quality, during operation and decommissioning; 4
· Where structures are located in areas where there is a risk
of high seismic loadings, the independent review should
include a check on the maximum design earthquake 

assumptions and the stability of the structure to ensure
that the design is such that during seismic events there will
be no uncontrolled release of tailings;
· Design of tailings storage facilities should take into account
the specific risks / hazards associated with geotechnical
stability or hydraulic failure and the associated risks to
downstream economic assets, ecosystems and human
health and safety. Environmental considerations should
thus also consider emergency preparedness and response
planning and containment / mitigation measures in case of
catastrophic release of tailings or supernatant waters;
· Any diversion drains, ditches, and stream channels to
divert water from surrounding catchment areas away from
the tailings structure should be built to the flood event
recurrence interval standards outlined elsewhere in this
Section;
· Seepage management and related stability analysis should
be a key consideration in design and operation of tailings
storage facilities. This is likely to require a specific
piezometer based monitoring system for seepage water
levels within the structure wall and downstream of it, which
should be maintained throughout its life cycle;
· Consideration of zero discharge tailings facilities and
completion of a full water balance and risk assessment for
the mine process circuit including storage reservoirs and
tailings dams. Consideration of use of natural or synthetic
liners to minimize risks;
· Design specification should take into consideration the
probable maximum flood eventand the required freeboard
to safely contain it (depending on site specific risks) across
the planned life of the tailings dam, including its
decommissioned phase;
· Where potential liquefaction risks exist, including risks
associated with seismic behavior, the design specification 
should take into consideration the maximum design
earthquake;
· On-land disposal in a system that can isolate acid
leachate-generating material from oxidation or percolating
water, such as a tailings impoundment with dam and
subsequent dewatering and capping. On-land disposal
alternatives should be designed, constructed and operated
according to internationally recognized geotechnical safety
standards;
· Thickening or formation of paste for backfilling of pits and
underground workings during mine progression.
Riverine (e.g. rivers, lakes, and lagoons) or shallow marine
tailings disposal is not considered good international industry
practice. By extension, riverine dredging which requires riverine
tailings disposal is also not considered good international
practice.
Deep sea tailings placement (DSTP) may be considered as an
alternative only in the absence of an environmentally and
socially sound land-based alternative and based on an
independent scientific impact assessment. If and when DSTP is
considered, such consideration should be based on detailed
feasibility and environmental and social impact assessment of
all tailings management alternatives, and only if the impact
assessment demonstrates that the discharge is not likely to
have significant adverse effects on marine and coastal
resources, or on local communities.
Leach-pad Waste
Recommended practices for the management of leach-pad
waste include the following:
· Leachate collection and treatment should continue until the
final effluent criteria are consistentwith guideline values in
Section 2.0;

· Decommissioned leach pads should utilize a combination
of surface management systems, seepage collection, and
active or passive treatment systems to ensure post closure
water resource quality is maintained;
Waste Geochemical Characterization
Mining operations should prepare and implement ore and waste
geochemical characterization methods for proper routing of
Potentially-Acid-Generating (PAG) ma terials and ARD
management programs that include the following elements:
· Conducting a comprehensive series of accelerated
leaching tests from feasibility study stage onwards, to
evaluate the potential for ARD in all formations foreseen to
be disturbed or otherwise exposed by the mine according
to internationally recognized methodologies;
5
· Conducting comprehensive ARD / metals leaching (ML)
testing / mapping on an ongoing basis with decreasing
block size as formations are transferred from long- to
medium- and short-term mining plans;
· Implementation of ARD and ML preventive actions to
minimize ARD including:
o Limiting exposure of PAG materials by phasing of
development and construction, together with covering,
and/or segregating runoff for treatment
o Implementation of water management techniques
such as diverting clean runoff away from PAG
materials, and segregating “dirty” runoff from PAG
materials for subsequent treatment; grading PAG
material piles to avoid ponding and infiltration; and
removing pit water promptly to minimize acid
generation

Drainage Prevention and Mitigation, available at:
http://www.osmre.gov/amdpvm.htm and Policy for Metal Leaching and Acid
Rock Drainage at Mine Sites in British Columbia (BC MEM 1998) available at:
www.em.gov.bc.ca/Mining/MinePer/ardpolicy.htm



· Controlled placement of PAG materials (including wastes)
to provide permanent conditions that avoid contact with
oxygen or water including6:
o Submerging and/or flooding of PAG materials by
placing PAG materials in an anoxic (oxygen free)
environment, typically below a water cover
o Isolating PAG materials above the water table with an
impermeable cover to limit infiltration and exposure to
air. Covers are typically less of a concern in arid
climates where there is limited precipitation, and
should be appropriate for local climate and vegetation
(if any)
o Blending of PAG materials with non-PAG or alkaline
materials can also be employed to neutralize acid
generation, as appropriate. Blending should be based
on full characterization of each of the blended
materials, the ratio of alkaline materials to acid
generating materials, the case histories of failed
operations, and the need for static and long-term
kinetic tests.
General Non-Hazardous Waste
Recommended practices for the management of household and
non-process related industrial waste include the following:
· Non-hazardous solid wastes should be managed according
to the recommendations presented in the General EHS
Guidelines;
· Non-hazardous solid waste should be collected for
recycling or disposal at an approved sanitary landfill.
External landfills should be audited by the mine to ensure
appropriate waste management practices. When such a
facility is not available within a feasible distance, the mine
should establish and operate its own with appropriate 

regulatory permits and scientifically defensible studies that
can demonstrate that the disposal of the hazardous waste
will not impact human health and the environment;
7
· Non-hazardous solid waste should not be disposed of
together with waste rock or overburden except under
exceptional circumstances to be fully documented in the
environmental and social assessment of the project.
Hazardous Waste
Recommended practices for the management of hazardous
waste include the following:
· Hazardous waste, including waste oils and chemicals,
spent packaging materials and containers, should be
managed as described in the General EHS Guidelines;
· Hazardous waste should be handled by specialized
providers (in accordance with regulatory permi ts) of
hazardous waste management facilities specifically
designed and operated for this purpose. When such
services are unavailable within a feasible distance of the
mine, the mine should establish and operate its own waste
facility with the necessary permits;
· Combustion of waste oils should preferably be undertaken
as a supplementary fuel in power generation facilities and
in accordance with emissions guidelines applicable to
combustion sources (see the General EHS Guidelines
and the EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power).
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials should be handled, stored, and transported
so as to avoid leaks, spills or other types of accidental releases
into soils, surface water, and groundwater resources. In order to
minimize the risk associated with accidental spills from storage 

tanks and pipelines (e.g. tailings pipelines) the recommended
mitigation measures include:
· Providing secondary containment to restrict movement into
receiving water bodies (e.g. sumps, holding areas,
impermeable liners), for example:
o Constructing pipelines with double-walled or thickwalled
sections at critical locations (e.g. large stream
crossings)
o Installing shutoff valves to minimize spill volumes and
to isolate flow in critical areas
Additional detailed guidance for hazardous materials
management including spill prevention and control planning for
the handling, storage, and transport of such materials as fuels
and chemicals is provided in the General EHS Guidelines. .
Cyanide
Cyanide use should be consistent with the principles and
standards of practice of the International Cyanide Management
Code.8 The Cyanide Code includes principles and standards
applicable to several aspects of cyanide use including its
purchase (sourcing), transport, handling / storage, use, facilities
decommissioning, worker safety, emergency response, training,
and public consultation and disclosure. The Code is a voluntary
industry program developed through a multi-stakeholder
dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations Environment
Programme and administered by the International Cyanide
Management Institute.
Land Use and Biodiversity
Habitat alteration is one of the most significant potential threats
to biodiversity associated with mining. Habitat alteration may
occur during any stage of the mine cycle with the greatest 

potential for temporary or permanent alteration of terrestrial and
aquatic habitats occurring during construction and operational
activities. Additionally, exploration activities often require the
development of access routes, transportation corridors, and
temporary camps to house workers which may all result in
varying degrees of land-clearing and population in-migration.
Depending on the type of mining, development and construction
activities often require land clearing for the mine as well as for
the process plant, tailings facility, waste and stockpile areas,
and infrastructure such as buildings, roads, construction camps,
town sites, water management structures, power plant,
transmission lines and access corridors to the mine site.
The protection and conservation of biodiversity is fundamental
to sustainable development. Integrating conservation needs and
development priorities in a way that meets the land use needs of
local communities is often a critical issue for mining projects.
Recommended strategies include consideration of the following:
· Whether any critical natural habitats 9 will be adversely
impacted or critically endangered or endangered species
reduced;
· Whether the project is likely to impact any protected areas;
· The potential for biodiversity offset projects (e.g. proactive
management of alternative high biodiversity areas in cases
where losses have occurred on the main site due to the
mining development) or other mitigative measures;
· Whether the project or its associated infrastructure will
encourage in-migration, which could adversely impact
biodiversity and local communities;


8 International Cyanide Management Code available at:
http://www.cyanidecode.org/

9 As defined in IFC’s Performance Standard (PS ) 6 – Biodiversity Conservation
and Sustainable Natural Resource Management. Readers should consult
the definition and requirements applicable to Critical Habitat in the
PS. 


· Consideration of partnerships with internationally
accredited scientific organizations to, for example,
undertake biodiversity assessments, conduct ongoing
monitoring, and manage biodiversity programs;
· Consultation with key stakeholders (e.g. government, civil
society, and potentially affected communities) to
understand any conflicting land use demands and the
communities dependency on natural resources and / or
conservation requirements that may exist in the area. 


Terrestrial Habitats
Temporary and permanent terrestrial habitat alteration should
be minimized to the extent feasible and be consistent with the
requirement to protect and preserve critical habitat.
Recommended management strategies include10:
· Siting access routes and facilities in locations that avoid
impacts to critical terrestrial habitat, and planning
exploration and construction activities to avoid sensitive
times of the year;
· Minimizing disturbance to vegetation and soils;
· Implementation of mitigation measures appropriate for the
type of habitat and potential impacts including, for example,
post-operation restoration (which may include baseline
inventories, evaluations, and eventual rescue of species),
offset of losses, or compensation of direct users;
· Avoiding or minimizing the creation of barriers to wildlife
movement, or threats to migratory species (such as birds)
and providing alternative migration routes when the
creation of barriers cannot be avoided;
· Planning and avoiding sensitive areas and implementing
buffer zones;

· Conducting activities such that the risk of landslides, debris
or mud flows, and bank or alluvial fan destabilization is
minimized;
· Implementing soil conservation measures (e.g.
segregation, proper placement and stockpiling of clean
soils and overburden material for existing site remediation);
key factors such as placement, location, design, duration,
coverage, reuse, and single handling should be
considered;
· Where topsoil is pre-stripped, it should be stored for future
site rehabilitation activities. Topsoil management should
include maintenance of soil integrity in readiness for future
use. Storage areas should be temporarily protected or
vegetated to prevent erosion;
· Conserving the quality and composition of growth medium
for use (e.g. for capping) during site reclamation and
closure activities;
· Ensuring that the growth medium is sufficient to support
native plant species appropriate for the local climate and
consistent with proposed future land uses. Overall
thickness of the growth medium should be consistent with
surrounding undisturbed areas and future land use;
· Manage vegetation growth along access roads and at
permanent above-ground facilities. Remove invasive plant
species and replant native species. Vegetation control
should employ biological, mechanical and thermal
vegetation control measures and avoid the use of chemical
herbicides as much as possible.
If it is demonstrated that the use of herbicides is required to
control vegetation growth along access roads or at facilities,
then personnel should be trained in their use. Herbicides that
should be avoided include those listed under the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended Classification of Pesticides
by Hazard Classes 1a and 1b, the WHO recommended 

Classification of Pesticides by Hazard Class II (if the project host
country lacks restrictions on distribution and use of these
chemicals, or if they are likely to be accessible to personnel
without proper training, equipment, and facilities to handle,
store, apply, and dispose of these products properly), and
Annexes A and B of the Stockholm Convention, except under
the conditions noted in the convention. 11



10 Additional information on biodiversity conversation strategies can be found at
“Integrating Mining and Biodiversity Conservation – Case Studies from around
the world” (IUCN and ICMM, 2004) and “Good Practice Guidance for Mining and
Biodiversity” (ICMM 2006). 



Aquatic Habitats
Aquatic habitats may be altered through changes in surface
water and groundwater regimes, and resulting increased
pressures on fish and wildlife communities. Earth-moving
operations may mobilize sediment which can enter
watercourses and disrupt water quality and quantity.
Recommended management strategies include the following:
· Minimizing the creation and extent of new access corridors;
· Decommissioning and re-vegetating exploration access
routes, and installing barricades to limit access;
· Maintaining, to the extent possible, natural drainage paths
and restoring them if they are disrupted;
· Maintaining water body catchment areas equal or
comparable to pre-development conditions;
· Protecting stream channel stability by limiting in-stream
and bank disturbance, and employing appropriate setbacks
from riparian zones;
· Attenuating surface runoff from high precipitation events
using on-site storage and water management infrastructure
(e.g. storage ponds, sumps, low gradient ditches, clean
water diversions);
· Designing temporary and permanent bridges and culverts
to manage peak flows depending on the associated
potential risk;

· Constructing, maintaining, and reclaiming watercourse
crossings that are stable, safe for the intended use, and
that minimize erosion, mass wasting and degradation of
the channel or lake bed.
Marine Habitats
Aquatic habitats in marine environments may be altered by
marine dredge mining, deep sea mining, off- shore loading
activities, port construction, and tailings disposal. Rivers and
run off impacted by mining operations can also impact the
marine environment. Key impacts of concern to the marine
environment may include habitat disturbance and destruction,
suspension of sediment in the water column, change in water
temperature, and changed water quality . Project sponsors
should engage the services of appropriate specialists to carry
out marine impact assessments which also include socioeconomic
impacts (e.g. impacts on fishing grounds).
Assessment and management of impacts should be in
compliance with applicable host-country commitments to
international conventions, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea.12

11 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2001).

12 The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) includes
numerous requirements applicable to navigation, resource use, and resource
protection in the territorial sea and contiguous zone of signatory states. The full
text of the convention is available at: http://www.un.org/Depts/los/index.htm




Air Quality
Management of ambient air quality at mine sites is important at
all stages of the mine cycle. Airborne emissions may occur
during each stage of the mine cycle, although in particular
during exploration, development, construction, and operational
activities. The principal sources include fugitive dust from
blasting, exposed surfaces such as tailings facilities, stockpiles,
waste dumps, haul roads and infrastructure, and to a lesser
extent, gases from combustion of fuels in stationary and mobile
equipment. Guidance on ambient air quality considerations is
provided in the General EHS Guidelines. 


Dust
Fugitive dust emissions from the dry surfaces of tailings
facilities, waste dumps, stockpiles and other exposed areas
should be minimized. Recommended dust management
strategies include:
· Dust suppression techniques (e.g. wetting down, use of allweather
surfaces, use of agglomeration additives) for roads
and work areas, optimization of traffic patterns, and
reduction of travel speeds;
· Exposed soils and other erodible materials should be
revegetated or covered promptly;
· New areas should be cleared and opened-up only when
absolutely necessary;
· Surfaces should be re-vegetated or otherwise rendered
non-dust forming when inactive;
· Storage for dusty materials should be enclosed or operated
with effi cient dust suppressing measures;
· Loading, transfer, and discharge of materials should take
place with a minimum height of fall, and be shielded
against the wind, and consider use of dust suppression
spray systems ;
· Conveyor systems for dusty materials should be covered
and equipped with measures for cleaning return belts.
Gaseous Emissions
The main sources of gaseous emissions are from combustion of
fuels in power generation installations, mobile emissions,
methane emissions and from drying, roasting, and smelting
operations. Recommended emissions reduction and control
strategies for stationary steam and power generation activities
from sources with a capacity equal to or lower than 50 Megawatt
thermal (MWth) and from mobile sources are addressed in the

General EHS Guidelines. Power sources with a capacity
greater than 50MWth are addressed in the EHS Guidelines for
Thermal Power.
Smelting and Roasting
General recommendations related to smelting and refining may
be found in the EHS Guidelines for Base Metal Smelting and
Refining. However, there are a few issues which are specific to
the roasting and smelting of precious metals.
Many producers of precious metals smelt metal on site prior to
shipping to off site refineries. Typically gold and silver is
produced in small melting / fluxing furnaces which produce
limited emissions but have the potential for mercury emissions
from certain ores. Testing should be undertaken prior to melting
to determine whether a mercury retort is required for mercury
collection.
Operations that employ roasting of concentrates are often
associated with elevated levels of mercury, arsenic and other
metals as well as SO2 emissions. Recommended management
strategies include:
· Operations at controlled temperature (higher
temperature roasters generally cause more problems
of contaminant control)
· Inclusion of an appropriate gas scrubbing system
Smelting of Platinum Group Metals (PGM) is similar to nickel
and aluminumsmelting. Care should be taken to avoid
formation of nickel carbonyl and chromium VI during the
smelting process. Where methane drainage (venting) is
practiced, consideration should be given to beneficial utilization
of the gas. 


Noise and Vibration
Sources of noise emissions associated with mining may include
noise from vehicle engines, loading and unloading of rock into
steel dumpers, chutes, power generation, and other sources
related to construction and mining activities. Additional
examples of noise sources include shoveling, ripping, drilling,
blasting, transport (including corridors for rail, road, and
conveyor belts), crushing, grinding, and stockpiling. Good
practice in the prevention and control of noise sources should
be established based on the prevailing land use and the
proximity of noise receptors such as communities or community
use areas. Recommended management strategies include:
· Noise levels at the nearest sensitive receptor should meet
the noise guidelines in the General EHS Guidelines;
· Where necessary, noise emissions should be minimized
and controlled through the application of techniques which
may include:
o Implementation of enclosure and cladding of
processing plants
o Installation of proper sound barriers and / or noise
containments, with enclosures and curtains at or near
the source equipment (e.g. crushers, grinders, and
screens)
o Installation of natural barriers at facility boundaries,
such as vegetation curtains or soil berms
o Optimization of internal-traffic routing, particularly to
minimize vehicle reversing needs (reducing noise from
reversing alarm) and to maximize distances to the
closest sensitive receptors
The most significant vibrations are usually associated with
blasting activities; however vibrations may also be generated by
many types of equipment. Mines should minimize significant
sources of vibration, such as through adequate design of
crusher foundations. For blasting-related emissions (e.g. 

vibration, airblast, overpressure, or fly rock), the following
management practices are recommended:
· Mechanical ripping should be used, where possible, to
avoid or minimize the use of explosives;
· Use of specific blasting plans, correct charging procedures
and blasting ratios, delayed / microdelayed or electronic
detonators, and specific in-situ blasting tests (the use of
downhole initiation with short-delay detonators improves
fragmentation and reduces ground vibrations);
· Development of blast design, including a blasting-surfaces
survey, to avoid overconfined charges, and a drill-hole
survey to check for deviation and consequent blasting
recalculations;
· Implementation of ground vibration and overpressure
control with appropriate drilling grids;
· Adequately designing the foundations of primary crushers
and other significant sources of vibrations.
Energy Use
Among the most significant energy consuming activities in
mining are transport, exploration activities, drilling, excavation,
extraction, grinding, crushing, milling, pumping, and ventilation
processes. Recommended energy conservation measures
include the following:
· Use of non-invasive technologies such as remote sensing
and ground-based technologies to minimize exploratory
digging and drilling;
· Correctly sizing motors and pumps used in the excavation,
ore moving, ore crushing, and ore handling process, as
well as using adjustable speed drives (ASDs) in
applications with highly varying load requirements.

Visual Impact
Mining operations, and in particular surface mining activities,
may result in negative visual impacts to resources associated
with other landscape uses such as recreation or tourism.
Potential contributors to visual impacts include highwalls,
erosion, discolored water, haul roads, waste dumps, slurry
ponds, abandoned mining equipment and structures, garbage
and refuse dumps, open pits, and deforestation. Mining
operations should prevent and minimize negative visual impacts
through consultation with local communities about potential
post-closure land use, incorporating visual impact assessment
into the mine reclamation process. Reclaimed lands should, to
the extent feasible, conform to the visual aspects of the
surrounding landscape. The reclamation design and procedures
should take into consideration the proximity to public viewpoints
and the visual impact within the context of the viewing
distance. 13 Mitigation measures may include strategic
placement of screening materials including trees and use of
appropriate plant species in the reclamation phase as well as
modification in the placement of ancillary facilities and access
roads.
1.2 Occupational Health and Safety
Mining activities should seek to provide an operation where
people are able to work without being injured and where the
health of the workforce is promoted. Facility -specific
occupational health and safety hazards should be identified
based on job safety analysis or comprehensive hazard or risk
assessment using established methodologies such as a hazard
identification study [HAZID], hazard and operability study
[HAZOP], or a quantitative risk assessment [QRA]. As a general
approach, health and safety management planning should

include the adoption of a systematic and structured approach for
prevention and control of physical, chemical, biological, and
radiological health and safety hazards described in the General
EHS Guidelines.
Occupational health and safety issues occur during all phases of
the mine cycle and can be classified according to the following
categories:
· General workplace health and safety
· Hazardous substances
· Use of explosives
· Electrical safety and isolation
· Physical hazards
· Ionizing radiation
· Fitness for work
· Travel and remote site health
· Thermal stress
· Noise and vibration
· Specific hazards in underground mining (Fires, explosions,
confined spaces and oxygen deficient atmospheres)

13 An example of a visual impact assessment methodology that can be used to
help prioritize prevention and mitigation measures includes the United States
Bureau of Land Management’s Visual Resource Contrast Rating system
(http://www.blm.gov/nstc/VRM/8431.html)


General Workplace Health and Safety
Recommended strategies to manage general workplace safety
hazards include the following:
· Mining exploration and development activities should
manage occupational health and safety hazards as part of
a comprehensive health and safety management plan
incorporating the following aspects:
o Preparation of emergency response plans specifically
applicable to exploration and production activities
(considering the often geographically isolated nature
of mining sites) and including the provision and 

maintenance of necessary emergency response and
rescue equipment;
o Sufficient number of first aid trained employees to
respond to emergencies;
o Implementation of specific personnel training on worksite
health and safety management including a
communication program with a clear message about
corporate management’s commitment to health and
safety. The communication program should also
include regular meetings such as daily talks prior to
initiation of work shifts;
o Integration of behavioral considerations into health
and safety management, including on-the-job
behavioral observation processes;
o Training of employees on the recognition and
prevention of occupational hazards specifically
applicable to work in remote areas such as safety with
respect to wildlife; protection against the elements;
thermal stress; acclimatization; disease exposure; and
navigational aids to avoid becoming lost;
· Illumination systems should be adequate and safe 14 for the
planned working conditions in travel paths, mine working
areas, and within and around surface facilities and
dumpsites of mines (see the illumination guideline values
presented in Section 2.0). Additional illumination guidance
includes adherence to local standard requirements for
illumination for mobile equipment operating above ground
and on public roads;15
· Signage in hazardous and risky areas, installations,
materials, safety measures, emergency exits, and other
such areas should be in accordance with international
standards (including standards of cleanliness, visibility and 

reflectance in areas of potentially poor illumination or
sources of dust and pollution), be known and easily
understood by workers, visitors, and as appropriate the
general public;
· To the extent that alternative technologies, work plans or
procedures cannot eliminate or sufficiently reduce a hazard
or exposure, the mine operators should provide workers
and visitors with the necessary personal protective
equipment (PPE), and provide instruction and monitoring in
their appropriate maintenance and use. Applicable PPE
include, at a minimum, safety helmets and footwear, in
addition to ear, eye, and hand protection devices.
· Occupational health assessments should be conducted for
employees on a regular basis, based on exposure to risk.
Medical records should be retained for at least 20 years. 

14 Considering the need to avoid such things as glare or potential sources of
ignition.
15 As a general rule, mobile equipment should produce an illumination level of
50 Lux across the passage at a distance of 1.5 times the stopping distance.

Hazardous Substances
Working areas should be provided with adequate ventilation and
dust/ fume extraction systems to ensure that inhalation
exposure levels for potentially corrosive, oxidizing, reactive or
siliceous substances are maintained and managed at safe
levels as described in the General EHS Guidelines. In addition
eye wash and emergency shower systems should be provided
in areas where there exists the possibility of chemical
contamination of workers and the need for rapid treatment.
Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) should be available for
all hazardous materials held on site.
Use of Explosives
Blasting activities that may result in safety impacts are typically
related to accidental explosion and poor coordination and
communication of blasting activities. Recommended explosives
management practices include:

· Using, handling, and transporting explosives in accordance
with local and / or national explosives safety regulations;
· Assigning certified blasters or explosives experts to
conduct blasts;
· Actively managing blasting activities in terms of loading,
priming, and firing explosives, drilling near explosives,
misfired shots and disposal;
· Adoption of consistent blasting schedules, minimizing
blast-time changes;
· Specific warning devices (e.g. horn signals, flashing lights)
and procedures should be implemented before each
blasting activity to alert all workers and third parties in the
surrounding areas (e.g. the resident population). Warning
procedures may need to include traffic limitation along local
roadways and railways;
· Specific personnel training on explosives handling and
safety management should be conducted;
· Blasting-permit procedures should be implemented for all
personnel involved with explosives (handling, transport,
storage, charging, blasting, and destruction of unused or
surplus explosives);
· Blasting sites should be checked post-blast by qualified
personnel for malfunctions and unexploded blasting
agents, prior to resumption of work;
· Specific audited procedures should be implemented for all
activities related to explosives (handling, transport, storage,
charging, blasting, and destruction of unused or surplus
explosives) in accordance with relevant national or
internationally recognized fire and safety codes;
· Qualified security personnel should be used to control
transport, storage, and use of explosives on site.
Electrical Safety and Isolation
Electrical safety and isolation of all sources of hazardous energy
and hazardous substances should be undertaken in accordance 
with the General EHS Guidelines. Recommended
management practices for mining operations include:
· Development of electrical competency standards and
safe work procedures for all electrical work, including
construction, decommissioning and demolition of
electrical equipment;
· Use of electrical safety devices on all final distribution
circuits, and appropriate testing schedules applied to
such safety systems;
· All sources of hazardous energy or hazardous
substances should have written procedures for
isolation, identifying how the system, plant or
equipment can be made and kept safe.
Physical hazards
Physical hazards in mining activities may include: the threat of
landslides, rockfalls, face slumping, or land collapse in
aboveground or underground mining environments; hazards
related to transport (e.g. trucks, elevated haul roads, and
railways), hazards related to height and falling, and use of fixed
and mobile equipment, lifting and hoisting devices, and moving
machinery.. Recommended prevention and control strategies
include:
Geotechnical Safety
· Planning, designing, and operating all structures such as
open pits, waste dumps, tailing dams, containment facilities
and underground excavations such that geotechnical risks
are appropriately managed throughout the entire mine
cycle. Additional levels of safety should be applied in active
seismic areas and those potentially exposed to extreme
climatic events. Systematic monitoring and regular review
of geotechnical stability data should be carried out Long 

term stability of worked-out sites should be adequately
addressed for both surface and underground mines;
· For waste dumps, fills and other containment structures,
static safety factors should be established based on the
level of hazard for the operational phase of a facility and at
closure;
· Potential change of geotechnical properties in dumps due
to chemical or biologically catalyzed weathering should be
considered. Design of new facilities has to provide for such
potential deterioration of geotechnical properties with
higher factors of safety. Stability / safety assessments of
existing facilities should take these potential changes into
account;
· Accurate assessment of worksite safety from rockfall
and/or landslide should be conducted. Particular attention
should be given after heavy rainfall, seismic events and
after blasting activities. Risks should be minimized by
appropriate bench and pit slope design, blast pattern
design, rock scaling, protective berms and minimizing
traffic.
· Assessment of the natural topography around the mine
site, as well as mine related infrastructure such as cut
slopes, road alignments should be included in geotechnical
stability analyses. Especially in tropical climates or seismic
zones with deeply weathered soils and high precipitation,
natural geotechnical risks may exist even before the start
of mining activities. These conditions can be especially
hazardous for settlements / housing related to mining
activities. Especially underground, but also for surface
features, modern topographical 3D deformation
measurements and related specific processing and
evaluation software should be the standard method for
stability monitoring.

Machine and Equipment Safety
To prevent and control hazards related to machine and
equipment use, measures for the enhancement of visibility
should be applied throughout the mine. Specific visibility
management practices may include the following:
· Use of contrast coloring on equipment / machinery,
including the provision of reflective markings to enhance
visibility;
· Use of moving equipment / machinery equipped with
improved operator sight lines;16
· Issuing workers high visibility clothing;
· Use of reflective markings on structures, traffic junctions,
and other areas with a potential for accidents (e.g. walls in
static locations should be whitewashed for improved
reflectance);
· Use of appropriate illumination for the immediate operating
areas of frequently turning and reversing equipment /
machinery;
· Installing safety barriers in high-risk locations of internal
roads / transport corridors. Barriers may be constructed
with refuse or other materials capable to stopping vehicles.

Recommendations for the management of work in confined
spaces or excavations, and work at heights, are provided in the
General EHS Guidelines.

16 Sight lines of new equipment should be assessed using tools such as the
United States National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
Visibility Analysis Software available at:
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/mining/illum/.


Ionizing Radiation
Where natural radiation hazards exist, the recommended
mitigation measures include the following:
· Implementing a radiation dosimetry monitoring program for
any areas where workers may be expected to receive

whole body doses of greater than 6 millisieverts in a 12-
month period (see Effective Dose Limits for Occupational
Ionizing Radiation presented in Section 2.0). The program
should include workplace assessments as well as personal
monitoring.
Fitness for work
Mining operations often have a number of activities where
fatigue or other causes of impaired fitness for work could
produce potential for serious injury, equipment damage or
environmental impact. A risk assessment should be conducted
to identify roles where “fitness for work” (including personal
fitness) is required to ensure that the activity is completed with
minimized risk. The recommended mitigation measures could
include:
· Review of shift management systems to minimize risk
of fatigue among employees;
· Tailoring of pre-placement medical exams to the
requirements expected of an employee (i.e. good
eyesight for a driver);
· Development of an alcohol and other drugs policy for
the operation.
Travel and remote site health
Mining operations are often located in very remote regions, with
limited access to high quality emergency or general medical
services. To minimize risk from health impacts associated with
frequent travel (as seen in exploration teams) and remote sites,
the following mitigation measures can be recommended:
· Development of programs to prevent both chronic and
acute illnesses through appropriate sanitation and
vector control systems;
· Identification of risks associated with operating at
altitude;

· Where food is prepared at a mining operation, food
preparation, storage and disposal should be reviewed
regularly and monitored to minimize risk of illness.
Thermal stress
Mining operations can require exposure of workers to extreme
weather conditions. High temperature conditions generated by
industrial processes can also result in thermal stress and should
be considered. Thermal stress related to underground
operations is discussed later in the document.
Noise and Vibration
Noise and vibration sources should be managed as described
above in Section 1.1. Additional recommendations for the
management of occupational exposures to noise and vibrations
include:
· Reduction of noise to acceptable occupational exposure
levels as described in the General EHS Guidelines;
· Ensuring that large equipment (e.g. excavators, dumpers,
dozers, wagon-drills, and other automated equipment that
requires an operator) is equipped with a soundproof cab;
· After all other options have been explored and
implemented, use of personal hearing protection, as
described in the General EHS Guidelines;
· Exposure to hand-arm vibration from hand and power tools
or whole-body vibration from surfaces on which the worker
stands or sits should be adequately controlled through the
selection and maintenance of equipment which meets
occupational vibration exposure standards.
Specific Hazards in Underground Mining
The following occupational health and safety hazards are
specific to underground mining. As a general safety rule, a
tagging system should be implemented to account for all
persons traveling underground.

Ventilation
· Ventilation and air cooling systems should be appropriate
for the workplace activities and be able to maintain work
area temperatures and concentrations of contaminants at
safe levels. Ventilation is considered an integral and
essential part of the overall mine project and should be
treated as such. Ventilation operators and maintenance
personnel should undergo adequate training with respect to
issues such as explosive atmospheres, products of
combustion, dust (particularly if silica is present) and diesel
fumes;
· Underground mines should ensure a safe and clean source
of air for all areas expected to be occupied by workers.
Recommended management strategies include:
o Ensuring surface ventilation units and associated
auxiliary equipment are located and managed to
eliminate hazards that could jeopardize ventilation
equipment performance or ventilation air quality (e.g.
emissions sources and inflammable or explosive
materials should not be stored near air intakes);
o Operating auxiliary fans to avoid the uncontrolled
recirculation of air;
o Removing all persons from the mine, or moving them
to a refuge area (properly stocked with water and
food), if the main ventilation system is stopped other
than for a brief interruption;
o Barricading all areas that are not being ventilated and
posting warning signs to prevent inadvertent entry.
o All transformers, compressors, fuel bays and other
high hazard areas should be ventilated direct to return
airways;
· As appropriate, thermal conditions should be monitored to
identify when persons could be adversely affected by heat
and cold stress, and protective measures should be 

implemented. Temperatures should be maintained at
levels reasonable and appropriate for the activities
undertaken. Other practices should include heat tolerance
screening, acclimatization, water breaks, and adoption of
suitable work-rest regimens.
Dust
· Over and above the risks associated with dust identified
earlier in this document and in the General EHS
Guidelines, dust control should be fully integrated into
underground operating procedures, particularly associated
with blasting, drilling, and material transport and dumping.
Minimization of dust is key to improved visual clarity in an
underground setting, and also to the improvement of
worker health.
Fires and Explosions
Underground mines should prepare and implement plans to
prevent, detect, and combat the outbreak and spread of fires.
Fire and explosion prevention and control strategies include:
· Conducting fire hazard assessments on a recurrent basis
for early identification and minimization of areas where
risks of “rapidly escalating fires” occur (e.g. areas using
trackless diesel powered machinery);
· Identifying fire hazard areas using warning signs, and
prohibiting all persons from smoking, using open flame
lamps, matches or other types of ignition sources in the
designated fire hazard areas, unless under strict protocols
(e.g. welding protocol);
· Avoiding use of oil filled transformers underground;
· Inflammable materials should be stored in fireproofed
facilities equipped for containment of leaks and spills. An
appropriate fire detection and extinguishing system should
be installed at each such storage location; 

 Any storage for inflammable or hazardous materials
including explosives should be located, designed, equipped
and operated in accordance with relevant national or
internationally recognized fire and safety codes. Explosives
stores should be placed on surface except where local
conditions justify (e.g. security or extreme cold);
· Avoid and control conveyor belt fires by ensuring fire hoses
are operational and readily available along conveyor lines.
In underground mines classified as ‘gassy’ (which include most
coal mines) additional precautions should include:
· Preventing ignitions by installing automatic gas detectors
where electrically powered equipment is used, and other
gas detectors throughout the underground working areas
(e.g. at coal faces);
· Preventing ignition by restricting items made of, or
containing, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, or light metal
alloy unless there is no possibility of friction or impact, or
they are adequately coated with non-sparking material;
· Hand-held tools should be placed in a non-sparking
storage and appropriate permits obtained before use;
· Use of fire resistant hydraulic fluids in all underground
equipment;
· Management of inflammable and explosive gasses in
active and worked-out parts of underground mines unless
such sections have been completely sealed and possible
sources of ignition removed. When = 1 percent of methane
is present, all electrical and mechanical equipment should
be switched off. When = 1.5 percent of methane is present
everyone except for those equipped, trained, and required
for normalizing the situation should be evacuated and all
potential sources of ignition should be deactivated and
disconnected at the power source. Where methane
emission occurs, monitors and alarms should be installed,
as appropriate;

Installing and using fire doors.
Refuge Bays and Self Rescuers
· Underground mines should be designed and developed
with secondary or auxiliary exits and with mine refuge
chambers that are:
o Clearly identified
o Within 15 minute s traveling time from anywhere in the
mine for workplaces that are more than 300 m from a
mine portal or shaft station that is used to access the
workplace
o Constructed of non- combustible material, with a
sealing mechanism to prevent entry of gas, and of
sufficient size to accommodate all persons working in
the local vicinity
o Equipped with independent connections to the surface
for supply of air, communication (e.g. telephone),
water, and first aid facilities
· Based on an assessment of potential risk of encountering
oxygen deficient atmospheres (e.g. mines operating
trackless diesel powered equipment), underground mining
workers should be equipped and trained in the use of selfcontained
self-rescue devises (SCSRs) providing at least
double the time needed to reach a refuge bay or mine exit
(minimum 30 minutes). The SCSRs should be carried at all
times or be readily accessible and within reach of the
worker.
Illumination
Illumination systems should be adequate and safe 17 for the
planned working conditions in travel paths and mine working
areas (see the illumination guideline values presented in Section 

2.0). Additional illumination guidance specific to underground
mining includes:
· Underground illumination should be adequate for the safe
performance of all work functions and the safe movement
of workers and equipment;
18
· Permanent lighting that provides adequate illumination in
the following locations: all workshops, service garages, and
other places with moving machinery or where equipment
could be a hazard; underground main shaft stations and
active shaft landings; first aid stations; and conveyor
galleries, drives, and transfer stations;
· Separate and independent emergency light sources should
be provided at all places where a hazard could be caused
by a failure of the normal lighting system. The system
should turn on automatically, should be adequate to allow
the workers to conduct an emergency shutdown of
machinery, and should be tested on a regular basis;
· Underground workers should have an approved cap lamp
in their possession at all times while underground. The
peak luminance should be at least 1500 lux at 1.2 m from
the light source throughout the shift.
1.3 Community Health and Safety
Community health and safety issues that may be associated
with mining activities include transport safety along access
corridors, transport and handling of dangerous goods, impacts
to water quality and quantity, inadvertent development of new
vector breeding sites, and potential for transmission of
communicable diseases, e.g., respiratory and sexually
transmitted infections resulting from the influx of project labor. In
addition, there can be significant household and community 

level effects on the social determinants of health, e.g., drug,
alcohol, gender violence, and other psychosocial effects,
associated with the rapid influx of labor during construction and
operational phases. The rapid influx of labor and their
associated extended family members may also place a
significant burden on existing community health facilities and
resources. Finally, because of their large and generally positive
economic impacts, large mining developments can rapidly move
local communities from a pattern of infectious diseases, e.g.,
malaria, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, to a pattern
of non- communicable diseases, e.g., hypertension, diabetes,
obesity and cardiovascular disorders. The medical infrastructure
in many developing countries is often poorly equipped or
experienced in dealing with non-communicable diseases. .
Recommendations for the management of these issues are
described in the General EHS Guidelines. Additional concerns
specific to mining activities, with community health and safety
implications, and also broader EHS implications are considered
under the following headings:
Tailings Dam Safety
Dams, wet tailing impoundments, and other major wet
containment facilities represent a potential risk depending on
their location with regards to human settlements and other
community resources. Tailings dam health, safety and
environment considerations are covered earlier in this
document.
Water Storage Dams
Water storage dams can potentially create and change the
existing pattern of vector breeding sites. In areas where malaria
is common, the shorelines of the WSD may create a mosquito
breeding site because of the presence of a large, shallow, and
vegetated shoreline. In addition, the WSD may also create a 

new breeding site for the snail host of schistosomiasis, an
important parasitic disease that is common in many tropical
climates.
Land Subsidence
Land subsidence may occur as a result of underground or
solution mining activities. Land subsidence may leave land
prone to flooding and may otherwise damage property if it
leaves farmland unsuitable for further use. To minimize and / or
control changes in terrain due to land subsidence,
recommended management measures include the following:
· Developing the mine with consideration of the location /
size of the ore body, overlying strata, and required well
depths for extraction (e.g. there is generally less potential
for subsidence associated with increased extraction
depth s);
· Monitoring the size and shape of mined caverns using well
logging devices and operating techniques (e.g. solution
pressures and pumping rates over time, flow volumes,
temperatures, and specific gravities);
· Filling shafts, raises, stope openings, adits, and drifts
opening to the surface with reinforced concrete or with
other material to prevent or reduce subsidence in high risk
areas.;
· Subsidence areas should be managed to ensure adequate
drainage and re-established to previous land use or other
use acceptable to the community. Roads in such areas
should be adequately sign-posted.
Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency preparedness and response arrangements should
be commensurate to the potential for emergency situations,
reflecting the measures described in the General EHS
Guidelines. An Emergency Response Plan should be prepared
in accordance with the guidance of the UNEP APPEL for 

Mining: Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the
Local Level19 process.
Communicable Diseases
The nature of mining projects (e.g. location in remote areas with
long material / product supply chains) requires proactive and
sustained interventions to minimize the incidence and
transmission of communicable diseases caused by the influx of
migrant workers, associated extended family members and
other service workers at the site. Long haul transport activities
may serve as disease conduits particularly for sexually
transmitted infections. At the mine site, good international
industry practice for solid waste management, surface water
drainage, and sanitary wastewater management are usually
effective in reducing vector borne and water related
communicable diseases.
Project housing and catering facilities and services should be
designed and maintained according to internationally accepted
standards. Worker living quarters that are designed and
maintained to prevent over-crowding can reduce the
transmission of communicable respiratory diseases that may
transfer to local communities. Catering facilities and services
that are designed, maintained and operated according to
internationally accepted Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point
(HACCP) standards reduce the potential for transmission of
food related illnesses from the project to the community.
In many parts of the world the key threat to the viability of the
mining operation and the health of local communities are the
potential negative impacts on key social determinants of health
(i.e. drug, alcohol, sexually transmitted infections, and gender
violence). 


In many developing countries, there are significant pre-existing
burdens of all STIs including HIV, however, the potential of
triggering a new upsurge in these trends should be considered
when developing a mining project. The hallmark of this situation
is the “Four M’s”:
· Men – labor influx;
· Money – surge in disposable cash;
· Movement – development of new transport routes
facilitating access to rural communities;
· Mixing – interface of high prevalence rate groups (i.e.
police, security, truckers and sex workers) with local low
prevalence rate men and women.
Over time, the spread of HIV / AIDS is not only the cause of
immense human misery and suffering, but can also negatively
affect the company in terms of staff turnover, declining
productivity, increasing costs, changing markets, and access to
contracts and procurement opportunities. Mining operations
should define and understand the potential effect of HIV / AIDS,
and design an appropriate management response, including use
of: 20
· Strategies to manage the impact of diseases through
assessment, surveillance, actions plans, and monitoring;
· A workplace program to prevent new HIV infections and
provide care and support for infected and affected
employees;
· Outreach activities within the community, sector and / or
broader society.
Typical measures undertaken to reduce communicable disease
incidence involve:
· Preventing illness among workers and their families and in
local communities by: 

o Undertaking health awareness and education
initiatives
o Training health workers in disease treatment
o Providing treatment through standard case
management in on-site or community health care
facilities (e.g. immunization programs)
Specific Vector Control and Prevention Strategies
Reducing the impact of vector-borne disease (e.g. malaria) on
the long-term health of workers and in local communities is best
accomplished through implementation of an integrated set of
interventions aimed at eliminating the factors that lead to
disease. Therefore there are significant roles for both project
engineering and medical staffs. Project sponsors, in close
collaboration with community health authorities, should
implement an integrated control strategy for mosquito and other
arthropod-borne diseases that should generally involve:
· Implementation of an integrated vector control program;
· Engineering design reviews including careful scrutiny of
roads, water storage and control facilities and surface
water management strategies;
· Collaboration and exchange of in-kind services with other
control programs in the project area to maximize beneficial
effects, particularly distribution of treated bed nets;
· Development of the “A-B-C-D” program for all project
workers where A= awareness, B=bite control,
C=chemoprophylaxis for non-immune personnel and D=
diagnosis and treatment;
· Selective use of residual indoor spraying (IRS) for project
housing. IRS programs are complex and involve careful
design review, particularly a clear understanding of the
local mosquito vectors and their pre-existing resistance to
available insecticides; 


· Development of an effective short and long-term monitoring
and evaluation program for both workers and potentially
affected communities.
1.4 Mine Closure and Post-Closure
Closure and post-closure activities should be considered as
early in the planning and design stages as possible. Mine
sponsors should prepare a Mine Reclamation and Closure Plan
(MRCP) in draft form prior to the start of production, clearly
identi fying allocated and sustainable funding sources to
implement the plan. For short life mines, a fully detailed Mine
Reclamation and Closure Plan (with guaranteed funding) as
described below should be prepared prior to the start of
operations. A mine closure plan that incorporates both physical
rehabilitation and socio-economic considerations should be an
integral part of the project life cycle and should be designed so
that:
· Future public health and safety are not compromised;
· The after-use of the site is beneficial and sustainable to the
affected communities in the long term;
· Adverse socio-economic impacts are minimized and socioeconomic
benefits are maximized.
The MRCP should address beneficial future land use (this
should be determined using a multi-stakeholder process that
includes regulatory agencies, local communities, traditional land
users, adjacent leaseholders, civil society and other impacted
parties), be previously approved by the relevant national
authorities, and be the result of consultation and dialogue with
local communities and their government representatives.
The closure plan should be regularly updated and refined to
reflect changes in mine development and operational planning,
as well as the environmental and social conditions and 

circumstances. Records of the mine works should also be
maintained as part of the post-closure plan.
Closure and post closure plans should include appropriate
aftercare and continued monitoring of the site, pollutant
emissions, and related potential impacts. The duration of postclosure
monitoring should be defined on a risk basis; however,
site conditions typically require a minimum period of five years
after closure or longer.
The timing for finalization of the MRCP is site specific and
depends on many factors, such as potential mine life, however
all sites need to engage in some form of progressive restoration
during operations. While plans may be modified, as necessary,
during the construction and operational phases, plans should
include contingencies for temporary suspension of activities and
permanent early closure and meet the following objectives for
financial feasibility and physical / chemical / ecological integrity.
Financial Feasibility
The costs associated with mine closure and post-closure
activities, including post-closure care, should be included in
business feasibility analyses during the planning and design
stages. Minimum considerations should include the availability
of all necessary funds, by appropriate financial instruments, to
cover the cost of closure at any stage in the mine life, including
provision for early, or temporary closure. Funding should be by
either a cash accrual system or a financial guarantee. The two
acceptable cash accrual systems are fully funded escrow
accounts (including government managed arrangements) or
sinking funds. An acceptable form of financial guarantee must
be provided by a reputable financial institution. Mine closure
requirements should be reviewed on an annual basis and the
closure funding arrangements adjusted to reflect any changes. 

Physical Integrity
All structures (e.g. tailings impoundments) should remain stable
such that they do not impose a hazard to public health and
safety as a result of physical failure or physical deterioration.
Tailings structures should be decommissioned so that water
accumulation on the surface is minimized and that any water
from the surface of the structure can flow away via drains or
spillways and these can accommodate the maximum probable
flood event. Spillways, drains and diversion ditches must
continue to be maintained as required after closure, as they can
easily become choked after storm events. Structures should not
erode or move from their intended location under extreme
events or perpetual disruptive forces. Consideration should be
given to backfilling of mine workings.
Physical hazards such as unguarded roads, shafts, and other
openings should be effectively and permanently blocked from all
access to the public until such time that the site can be
converted into a new beneficial land use based on changed
conditions at the site, as well as alternative uses by local
communities or other industries for roads, buildings and other
structures. Where there is a risk of methane emanating from
disused shafts and other workings, passive venting systems
should be considered.
Chemical Integrity
Surface water and groundwater should be protected against
adverse environmental impacts resulting from mining and
processing activities. Leaching of chemicals into the
environment should be prevented, so as to avoid endangering
public health or safety or exceed water quality objectives in
downstream surface water and groundwater systems.
Ecological Habitat Integrity
While ecological habitat integrity is partially determined by the
above factors (e.g. physical issues such as slope stability) and 

chemical issues (e.g. such as metal contaminants), it is also
addressed with consideration towards replacement of habitat
that is beneficial for future ecological use. The Mine
Reclamation and Closure Plan (MRCP) should contain
comprehensive measures for concurrent reclamation during the
operating life of the mine according to a plan approved with the
environmental and mineral authorities and with the engagement
of local government and communities.
2.0 Performance Indicators and
Monitoring
2.1 Environment
Emissions and Effluent Guidelines
Table 1 presents effluent guideline values for this sector.
Guideline values for process effluents in this sector are
indicative of good international industry practice as reflected in
relevant standards of countries with recognized regulatory
frameworks. These guidelines should be achievable under
normal operating conditions in appropriately designed and
operated facilities through the application of pollution prevention
and control techniques discussed in the preceding sections of
this document.
Effluent guidelines should be applicable for site runoff and
treated effluents to surface waters for general use. Site-specific
discharge levels may be established based on the availability
and conditions in the use of publicly operated sewage collection
and treatment systems or, if discharged directly to surface
waters, on the receiving water use classification as described in
the General EHS Guideline.

Table 1. Effluent Guidelines
Pollutants Units Guideline Value
Total Suspended Solids mg/L 50
pH S.U. 6 – 9
COD mg/L 150
BOD5 mg/L 50
Oil and Grease mg/L 10
Arsenic mg/L 0.1
Cadmium mg/L 0.05
Chromium (VI) mg/L 0.1
Copper mg/L 0.3
Cyanide mg/L 1
Cyanide Free mg/L 0.1
Cyanide WAD mg/L 0.5
Iron (total) mg/L 2.0
Lead mg/L 0.2
Mercury mg/L 0.002
Nickel mg/L 0.5
Phenols mg/l 0.5
Zinc mg/L 0.5
Temperature OC <3 degree differential
Note: Metals concentrations represent total metals.


These levels should be achieved, without dilution, at least 95
percent of the time that the plant or unit is operating, to be
calculated as a proportion of annual operating hours. Deviation
from these levels in consideration of specific, local project
conditions should be justified in the environmental assessment.
Combustion source emissions guidelines associated with
steam- and power-generation activities from sources with a
capacity equal to or lower than 50 MWth are addressed in the
General EHS Guidelines with larger power source emi ssions 

addressed in the EHS Guidelines for Thermal Power. Guidance
on ambient considerations based on the total load of emi ssions
is provided in the General EHS Guidelines.
Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoring programs for this sector should be
implemented to address all activities that have been identified to
have potentially significant impacts on the environment, during
normal operations and upset conditions. Environmental
monitoring activities should be based on direct or indirect
indicators of emissions, effluents, and resource use applicable
to the particular project. In some mining projects monitoring
should extend for a minimum period of three years after closure
or longer if site conditions warrant.
Monitoring frequency should be sufficient to provide
representative data for the parameter being monitored.
Monitoring should be conducted by trained individuals following
monitoring and record-keeping procedures and using properly
calibrated and maintained equipment. Monitoring data should be
analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with
the operating standards so that any necessary corrective
actions can be taken. Additional guidance on applicable
sampling and analytical methods for emissions and effluents is
provided in the General EHS Guidelines.
2.2 Occupational Health and Safety
Performance
Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines
Occupational health and safety performance should be
evaluated against internationally published exposure guidelines,
of which examples include the Threshold Limit Value (TLV®)
occupational exposure guidelines and Biological Exposure
Indices (BEIs®) published by American Conference of 

Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), 21 the Pocket
Guide to Chemical Hazards published by the United States
National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH),22
Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) published by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United
States (OSHA),23 Indicative Occupational Exposure Limit Values
published by European Union member states, 24 or other similar
sources. Table 2 provides illumination guidelines for mining
activities. Table 3 provides ionizing radiation exposure
guidelines for mining workers.

Accident and Fatality Rates
Projects should try to reduce the number of accidents among
project workers (whether directly employed or subcontracted) to
a rate of zero, especially accidents that could result in lost work
time, different levels of disability, or even fatalities. Facility rates
may be benchmarked against the performance of facilities in this
sector in developed countries through consultation with
published sources (e.g. US Bureau of Labor Statistics and UK
Health and Safety Executive)27.

Occupational Health and Safety Monitoring
The working environment should be monitored for occupational
hazards relevant to the specific project. Monitoring should be
designed and implemented by accredited profe ssionals 28 as part
of an occupational health and safety monitoring program with
recognition for post-closure long term health concerns.
Facilities should also maintain a record of occupational
accidents and diseases and dangerous occurrences and
accidents. Additional guidance on occupational health and
safety monitoring programs is provided in the General EHS
Guidelines.
