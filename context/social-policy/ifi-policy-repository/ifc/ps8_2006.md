Performance Standard 8
Cultural Heritage

April 30, 2006


Introduction

1. Performance Standard 8 recognizes the importance of cultural heritage for current and future
generations. Consistent with the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and
Natural Heritage, this Performance Standard aims to protect irreplaceable cultural heritage and to
guide clients on protecting cultural heritage in the course of their business operations. In addition,
the requirements of this Performance Standard on a project’s use of cultural heritage are based in
part on standards set by the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Objectives
ß To protect cultural heritage from the adverse impacts of project activities and
support its preservation
ß To promote the equitable sharing of benefits from the use of cultural heritage in
business activities

Scope of Application

2. The applicability of this Performance Standard is establis hed during the Social and
Environmental Assessment process, while implementation of the actions necessary to meet the
requirements of this Performance Standard is managed through the client’s Social and
Environmental Management System. The assessment and management system requirements are
outlined in Performance Standard 1.

3. For the purposes of this Performance Standard, cultural heritage refers to tangible forms of
cultural heritage, such as tangible property and sites having archaeological (prehistoric),
paleontological, historical, cultural, artistic, and religious values, as well as unique natural
environmental features that embody cultural values, such as sacred groves. However, for the
purpose of paragraph 11 below, intangible forms of culture, such as cultural knowledge, innovations
and practices of communities embodying traditional lifestyles, are also included. The requirements of
this Performance Standard apply to cultural heritage regardless of whether or not it has been legally
protected or previously disturbed.

Requirements

Protection of Cultural Heritage in Project Design and Execution

Internationally Recognized Practices

4. In addition to complying with relevant national law on the protection of cultural heritage, including
national law im plementing the host country’s obligations under the Convention Concerning the
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage and other relevant international law, the client
will protect and support cultural heritage by undertaking internationally recognized practices for the
protection, field-based study, and documentation of cultural heritage. If the requirements of
paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 apply, the client will retain qualified and experienced experts to assist in
the Assessment.

Chance Find Procedures

5. The client is responsible for siting and designing a project to avoid significant damage to cultural
heritage. When the proposed location of a project is in areas where cultural heritage is expected to 
be found, either during construction or operations, the client will implement chance find procedures
established through the Social and Environmental Assessment. The client will not disturb any
chance finds further until an Assessment by a competent specialist is made and actions consistent
with the requirements of this Performance Standard are identified.
Consultation

6. Where a project may affect cultural heritage, the client will consult with affected communities
within the host country who use, or have used within living memory, the cultural heritage for longstanding
cultural purposes to identify cultural heritage of importance, and to incorporate into the
client’s decision-making process the views of the affected communities on such cultural heritage.
Consultation will also involve the relevant national or local regulatory agencies that are entrusted with
the protection of cultural heritage.
Removal of Cultural Heritage

7. Most cultural heritage is best protected by preservation in its place, since removal is likely to
result in irreparable damage or destruction of the cultural heritage. The client will not remove any
cultural heritage, unless the following conditions are met:
ß There are no technically or financially feasible alternatives to removal
ß The overall benefits of the project outweigh the anticipated cultural heritage loss
from removal
ß Any removal of cultural heritage is conducted by the best available technique
Critical Cultural Heritage

8. Critical cultural heritage consists of (i) the internationally recognized heritage of communities
who use, or have used within living memory the cultural heritage for long-standing cultural purposes;
and (ii) legally protected cultural heritage areas, including those proposed by host governments for
such designation.

9. The client will not significantly alter, damage, or remove any critical cultural heritage. In
exceptional circumstances , where a project may significantly damage critical cultural heritage, and its
damage or loss may endanger the cultural or economic survival of communities within the host
country who use the cultural heritage for long-standing cultural purposes , the client will: (i) meet the
requirements of Paragraph 6 above; and (ii) conduct a good faith negotiation with and document the
informed participation of the affected communities and the successful outcome of the negotiation. In
addition, any other impacts on critical cultural heritage must be appropriately mitigated with the
informed participation of the affected communities.

10. Legally protected cultural heritage areas are important for the protection and conservation of
cultural heritage, and additional measures are needed for any projects that would be permitted under
the applicable national laws in these areas. In circumstances where a proposed project is located
within a legally protected area or a legally defined buffer zone, the client, in addition to the
requirements for critical cultural heritage cited above in Paragraph 9, will meet the following
requirements :

ß Comply with defined national or local cultural heritage regulations or the protected
area management plans
ß Consult the protected area sponsors and managers, local communities and other
key stakeholders on the proposed project
ß Implement additional programs, as appropriate, to promote and enhance the
conservation aims of the protected area

Project’s Use of Cultural Heritage

11. Where a project proposes to use the cultural resources, knowledge, innovations, or practices of
local communities embodying traditional lifestyles for commercial purposes, the client will inform
these communities of: (i) their rights under national law; (ii) the scope and nature of the proposed
commercial development; and (iii) the potential consequences of such development. The client will
not proceed with such commercialization unless it: (i) enters into a good faith negotiation with the
affected local communities embodying traditional lifestyles; (ii) documents their informed participation
and the successful outcome of the negotiation; and (iii) provides for fair and equitable sharing of
benefits from commercialization of such knowledge, innovation, or practice, consistent with their
customs and traditions.
