## European Bank for Reconstruction and Development


http://www.ebrd.com/who-we-are/our-values/environmental-and-social-sustainability.html


The EBRD is committed to promoting environmentally and socially sound and sustainable development in the full range of our activities here at the Bank.

We seek to ensure that the projects we finance are socially and environmentally sustainable, respect the rights of affected workers and communities and are designed and operated in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and good international practices.

ESIA Listings

Full versions of the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) documents for our projects can be found using our ESIA listings, or by contacting the local EBRD office in each country. Full details of the local office relevant to each project are also found in the ESIA listings.

For the benefit of local stakeholders, the client makes the environmental and social impact assessments available near the project site in the local language. Clients are also obligated to provide at least an executive summary in English.

For further information, read the Bank’s Public Information Policy.

Project Complaint Mechanism

The Project Complaint Mechanism is EBRD’s new accountability tool, replacing the previous Independent Recourse Mechanism (IRM).

It assesses and reviews complaints about our projects. It gives local groups and individuals that may be directly and adversely affected by a project a means of raising complaints or grievances with us, independently from banking operations.

Civil Society Engagement Unit
 
Formal and informal dialogue between the EBRD and non-governmental organisations/local communities is facilitated by the Civil Society Engagement Unit.

Requests for Information

The Bank also has a procedure for handling requests for information under the Public Information Policy (PIP). If an information request is denied, the Procedure includes the possibility of an appeal to the Secretary General to review the request separately.

Internal evaluation of environmental and social impact

Internally, EBRD operations are scrutinised by the Evaluation team who:

* review project files
* liaise with the Environment and Sustainability team
* visit project facilities to draw lessons learned for the Bank
* assess change against the Bank's environmental and social policy and * national and EU standards
* evaluate policy and sector strategy implementation prior to review

Our key internal issues include:

1. Human capital development
1. Compensation and benefits
1. The health and safety of our employees and contractors
1. Security and emergency preparedness
1. Diversity, including gender equality
1. Energy efficiency of buildings
1. Use of renewable energy
1. Water consumption
1. Green procurement of office consumables
1. Paper consumption
1. Waste management
1. CO2 footprint of air and rail travel

### Policy


The EBRD is committed to promoting “environmentally sound and sustainable development” in the full range of its investment and technical cooperation activities. The Bank believes that environmental and social sustainability is a fundamental aspect of achieving outcomes consistent with its transition mandate and recognises that projects that foster environmental and social sustainability rank among the highest priorities of its activities.

The EBRD's latest Enviromental and Social Policy outlines how the Bank will address the environmental and social impacts of its projects by:

* Defining the respective roles and responsibilities of both EBRD and its clients in designing, implementing and operating projects;
* Setting a strategic goal to promote projects with high environmental and social benefits; and
* Mainstreaming environmental and social sustainability considerations into all its activities.

Along with the Bank's Public Information Policy and Project Complaint Mechanism, the ESP defines the Bank’s commitment to the principles of environmentally sound and sustainable development and good corporate citizenship.

The Environmental and Social Policy is implemented by our dedicated Environment & Sustainability Department.

EBRD-financed projects are expected to be designed and operated in compliance with good international practices relating to sustainable development. To help our clients and their projects achieve this, we have defined ten performance requirements covering the key areas of environmental and social issues and impacts.

The performance requirements provide a solid base from which clients can improve the sustainability of their business operations.

Where possible, projects should avoid adverse impacts on workers, communities, and the environment. If avoidance is not possible, negative impacts should be reduced, mitigated or compensate for, as appropriate.

New facilities or business activities financed by us must be designed to meet the performance requirements from the outset.

If a proposed business activity relates to existing facilities that do not meet the requirements at the time of Board approval, the client will be required to adopt and implement a satisfactory Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP).

If we are to provide general corporate finance, working capital or equity financing for a multi-site company, the client will be required to develop and implement an ESAP at the corporate level (as opposed to the site-specific level).

This must be both technically and financially feasible, and deliverable within an acceptable time frame.

**Policy Consultation Framework**

<!--
When the EBRD decided to develop an Indigenous Peoples policy, it naturally followed IFC's lead—oriented as both institutions are to private-sector operations. In terms of both content and structure...

EBRD’s mission is to aid in the “transition” to private sector economic development of the FSU and its eastern European allies. Since its founding in the early 1990s, it has closely modelled its social and environmental policies after those of the World Bank. After IFC separated its policies out from the World Bank a few years ago, the expectation was that EBRD’s new policies would follow closely, if not in lock-step, with those of IFC. To some degree, as point out above, this is indeed the case, but  there are nevertheless important exceptions, as also noted above.


Two key differences between EBRD and IFC indigenous policies are that EBRD applies its polices to cover impacts both positive and negative, while IFC restricts its policy to adverse impacts only. The other key difference is that EBRD is the first IFI to call for FPIC application to its indigenous-affecting projects, albeit with the proviso that this should only occur in the case of three special circumstances. 

Nevertheless, the introduction of FPIC in any manner to IFI indigenous policies is a significant development and even more so when it is estimated that the majority of EBRD projects affecting  indigenous communities will be covered by those at least one of those three special circumstances. 

Counter-balancing this innovation is the observation of some sceptics that as EBRD only recognizes the existence of indigenous Peoples in one of its borrower countries, albeit a major one (Russia), the actual affect of these moves will be limited to a few projects, at most, per year.

EBRD’s *[Environmental and Social Policy](http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/policies/2008policy.pdf)* (ESP) closely resembles IFC’s integrated safeguard framework.

EBRD names its policy prescripts as 'Performance Requirements'&mdash;terminology that is more compliance-oriented in tone than IFC's 'Performance Standards'.

EBRD policy makes a few notable structural changes and innovations.
