## International Finance Corporation (IFC)

The International Finance Corporation's [Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/ifc+sustainability/sustainability+framework/sustainability+framework+-+2012/framework_2012#AIP) establishes the corporation's over-arching social policy aims and objectives.  The Sustainability Framework is comprised of the *[Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/7540778049a792dcb87efaa8c6a8312a/SP_English_2012.pdf?MOD=AJPERES)*, which defines institutional commitments. IFC's operational requirements for borrowers and clients are defined in the [Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/ifc+sustainability/sustainability+framework/sustainability+framework+-+2012/performance+standards+and+guidance+notes+2012/performance+standards+-+2012).  IFC's Sustainability Framework also includes the [Access to Information Policy](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/CORP_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/IFC+Projects+Database/Projects/), which articulates IFC's commitment to transparency.

The IFC Sustainability Framework [first entered into force on April 30, 2006](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-ifc/policies-standards/ifcsustainabilityframework_2006). The Sustainability Framework was updated in 2012.  The [updated 2012 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-ifc/policies-standards/ifcsustainabilityframework_2012) applies to all investment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process after January 1, 2012. Prior to April 30, 2006, investments were subject to contemporanious versions of the IFC and World Bank Group [Safeguard Policies](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-ifc/policies-standards/safeguards-pre2006).

In addition to the Sustainability Framework, IFC provides operational guidance to its staff and clients in the from of proceedures, operational guidelines, and guidance notes.

### Sustainability Framework

The [Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/sustainabilityframework) articulates IFC's strategic commitment to sustainable development. The framework is a risk-management insturment--inteded to promote sound environmental and social practices via accountability and encourage transparency.  Originally adopted in 2006 [^1](# "The 2006 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to investments that go through IFC's initial credit review process from April 30, 2006 to December 31, 2011. Investments made prior to April 30, 2006 are subject to the Safeguard Policies."), the Sustainability Framework was updated in 2012 [^2](# "The updated 2012 edition of IFC's Sustainability Framework applies to all investment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process after January 1, 2012.
") following an 18-month consultation process with stakeholders around the world.

The Sustainability Framework consists of:

1. The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability, which defines IFC's commitments to environmental and social sustainability.
1. The Performance Standards, which define clients' responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks.
1. The Access to Information Policy, which articulates IFC's commitment to transparency.

### Sustainability Framework

[IFC Sustainability Framework](http://www.ifc.org/sustainabilityframework)

The Sustainability Framework articulates IFC's strategic commitment to sustainable development and is an integral part of our approach to risk management.

Our Sustainability Framework helps our clients do business in a sustainable way. It promotes sound environmental and social practices, encourages transparency and accountability, and contributes to positive development impacts. IFC's Performance Standards, which are part of the Sustainability Framework, have become globally recognized as a benchmark for environmental and social risk management in the private sector.

Originally adopted in 2006, the Sustainability Framework has recently been updated following an 18-month consultation process with stakeholders around the world.

Effective on January 1, 2012, our updates reflect the evolution in good practice for sustainability and risk mitigation over the past five years. They incorporate modifications on challenging issues that are increasingly important to sustainable businesses, including supply-chain management, resource efficiency and climate change, and business and human rights.

### IFC Performance Standards

---

IFC's Performance Standards, which are part of the Sustainability Framework, are a globally recognized as a benchmark for environmental and social risk management in the private sector. The Performance Standards define clients' roles and responsibilities for project management—including requirements for information disclosure.

The adoption of the International Finance Corporation’s 2006 Performance Standards on Social & Environmental Sustainability set a new trend for IFI social safeguards. Rather than relying on the multiple, individual operational policies of the World Bank (as was its previous practice), the IFC chose to develop an integrated bundle of social and environmental protections structured to provide a comprehensive policy framework, which IFC felt was more suited to the private sector—its client group.

Effective on January 1, 2012, our updates reflect the evolution in good practice for sustainability and risk mitigation over the past five years. They incorporate modifications on challenging issues that are increasingly important to sustainable businesses, including supply-chain management, resource efficiency and climate change, and business and human rights.

---

IFC's Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability (2006) define clients' roles and responsibilities for project management—including include requirements for information disclosure.

---

The Performance Standards are grouped into eight sections, each of which is coupled with Guidance Notes to further clarify client roles and responsibilities under the standards. The eight Performance Standards (PS) are:

PS 1:	Social and Environmental Assessment and Management System
PS 2:	Labor and Working Conditions
PS 3:	Pollution Prevention and Abatement
PS 4:	Community Health Safety and Security
PS 5:	Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement
PS 6:	Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management
PS 7:	Indigenous Peoples
PS 8:	Cultural Heritage

##### Policy on Disclosure of Information


2006 (Updated)

The 2006 IFC Policy on Disclosure of Information is a 13-page document outlining the scope of materials that IFC makes publically available—either on a routine basis or upon request. This disclosure policy is intended to reflect IFC’s commitment to transparent business practices in-line with the Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability and the Performance Standards.

In accordance with the prescripts of IFC’s Performance Standards, the disclosure policy necessitates that IFC clients self-disclose information to project-affected parties about all types of adverse environmental and social impacts resulting from the project, as well as the client’s plan to mitigate these impacts.

In addition, the document also defines how routinely provided information can be obtained from, the types of information that IFC does not routinely provide (a fairly standard list of exceptions intended to protect the financial and personal welfare of IFC, its clients, and its employees), and how IFC monitors its own implementation of this policy.

#### Environmental and Social Review Procedure

As part of IFC commitment to socially and environmentally sustainable development, the Environmental and Social Review Procedures (ESRP) [2009, version 4] establish and verify the sustainability of client projects, as well as their conformance with Performance Standards and the Extractive Industry Review (EIR).

Included within the ESRP is IFC’s explanation of the terms “Free Prior and Informed Consultation (FPIC)” and “Broad Community Support (BCS)” as part of the requirements for community consultation and Performance Standards and EIR. The ESRP also details which projects require FPIC and BCS and the methodology used by IFC to determine client fulfilment of these requirements.

As noted in the ESRP, both the PS and EIR requirements for FPIC and BCS are applicable to:

* Any proposed project with significant adverse impacts on affected  communities (i.e., in any project categorized ‘A’ by virtue of its predicted social impacts)
* Any proposed project where Indigenous People are directly affected. In such cases, there is an additional obligation for clients to enter into good faith negotiation with IPs as outlined in PS 7.1.

In order to verify the client’s fulfilment of the Performance Standards and EIR requirements for FPIC and BCS, the IFC has developed a documenting matrix. Essentially the matrix is designed to answer these two questions:

* Has the client conducted free, prior and informed consultation regarding the investment project, and enabled the informed participation of affected communities?
* What  is the level of support and dissent related to the project among the affected communities for the investment project?

Based upon the answers to these questions, IFC classifies the quality of its client’s consultation efforts and the projects conformance with the Performance Standards, the Extractive Industry Review, and IFC’s overall commitment to socially and environmentally sustainable development.

The ESRP also details IFC’s environmental and social appraisal process for direct investment projects and the environmental and social review process from public disclosure through the signing of legal documents. These processes involve s series of steps leading to an IFC approved Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) and Action Plan.

Finally, the ESRP outlines IFC’s procedures for direct investment supervision, the disclosure and supervision procedures concerning IFC’s financial intermediary investments, and the social and environmental requirements for IFC managed advisory services.&nbsp;

The Environmental and Social Review Procedures (ESRP) Manual defines IFC management-approved tasks to achieve client compliance with the Policy and Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, Access to Information Policy, and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.

The Manual describes how IFC conducts its environmental and social due diligence for the business activities involving direct investments, investments through financial intermediaries, and Advisory projects.

Earlier versions of IFC's environmental and social policies, procedures, and standards are provided as reference material only.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)<br>
2009, version 4<br>

As part of IFC commitment to socially and environmentally sustainable development, the Environmental and Social Review Procedures (ESRP) [2009, version 4] establish and verify the sustainability of client projects, as well as their conformance with Performance Standards and the Extractive Industry Review (EIR). 

Included within the ESRP is IFC’s explanation of the terms “Free Prior and Informed Consultation (FPIC)” and “Broad Community Support (BCS)” as part of the requirements for community consultation and Performance Standards and EIR. The ESRP also details which projects require FPIC and BCS and the methodology used by IFC to determine client fulfilment of these requirements.

As noted in the ESRP, both the PS and EIR requirements for FPIC and BCS are applicable to: 
* Any proposed project with significant adverse impacts on affected  communities (i.e., in any project categorized ‘A’ by virtue of its predicted social impacts)<br>
* Any proposed project where Indigenous People are directly affected. In such cases, there is an additional obligation for clients to enter into good faith negotiation with IPs as outlined in PS 7.1.

In order to verify the client’s fulfilment of the Performance Standards and EIR requirements for FPIC and BCS, the IFC has developed a documenting matrix. Essentially the matrix is designed to answer these two questions:
* Has the client conducted free, prior and informed consultation regarding the investment project, and enabled the informed participation of affected communities?<br>
* What  is the level of support and dissent related to the project among the affected communities for the investment project?

Based upon the answers to these questions, IFC classifies the quality of its client’s consultation efforts and the projects conformance with the Performance Standards, the Extractive Industry Review, and IFC’s overall commitment to socially and environmentally sustainable development.

The ESRP also details IFC’s environmental and social appraisal process for direct investment projects and the environmental and social review process from public disclosure through the signing of legal documents. These processes involve s series of steps leading to an IFC approved Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) and Action Plan. 

Finally, the ESRP outlines IFC’s procedures for direct investment supervision, the disclosure and supervision procedures concerning IFC’s financial intermediary investments, and the social and environmental requirements for IFC managed advisory services.&nbsp;

Stakeholder Engagement: A Good Practice Handbook for Companies Doing Business in Emerging Markets provides guidance on consultation and stakeholder engagement for private-sector companies. Although this handbook reiterates IFC requirements for early and sustained community engagement commensurate with project impacts, the focus of the manual is on effective practices.

The Handbook is divided into two parts. Part one, contains the key concepts and principles of stakeholder engagement, the practices that are known to be effective, and the tools to implement them. Topics covered in this section include: stakeholder identification and analysis, consultation with Indigenous People, equal gender representation, informed participation, negotiations, grievance management, disclosure, stakeholder monitoring, and management functions.  Part two shows how these principles, practices, and tools fit with the different phases of the project cycle, from initial concept, through construction and operations, to divestment and/or decommissioning. Essentially this section offers guidance on the best times to commence various stages of the stakeholder engagement process, such as property negations, environmental assessment consultations, the development of grievance management mechanisms, et

Interspersed throughout both sections of this manual are case studies which detail the experiences of various private companies successfully, and unsuccessfully, engaging in stakeholder engagement. One recommendation of particular relevance to the extractive industry, drawn from a case study of Glamis Gold, is that all parties who perceive themselves as stakeholders, including both NGO’s and governments, should be identified and appropriately engaged. Glamis Gold had to temporarily shut down its operations because it did not identify nor engage with parties, living outside of the direct influence of the project, who nevertheless perceived themselves as major stakeholders of the project.&nbsp;

## PS1: Social and Environmental Assessment and Management System

Among other issues, Performance Standard 1 establishes the importance of effective community engagement through disclosure of project-related information and consultation with local communities on matters that directly affect them. Community engagement is defined as “an on-going process involving the client’s disclosure of information… free of external manipulation, interference, or coercion, and intimidation, and conducted on the basis of timely, relevant, understandable and accessible information”. The purpose such engagement is “to build and maintain over time a constructive relationship with these communities”. The nature and frequency of community engagement must reflect the project’s risks to and adverse impacts on the affected communities. 

IFC articulates three general topics within the framework of community engagement: disclosure, consultation and grievance mechanisms.

**Disclosure**

IFC requires that clients publicly disclose the Assessment document. If communities face potential risks or adverse impacts from the project, clients must provide such communities with access to information on the purpose, nature and scale of the project, the duration of proposed project activities, and the nature of such potential risks and impacts. Disclosure should occur early in the Social and Environmental Assessment process and in any event before the project construction commences; disclosure must also be continued on an ongoing basis.

**Consultation**

If affected communities may be subject to risks or adverse impacts from a project, IFC requires that clients undertake a process of consultation in a manner that provides the affected communities with opportunities to express their views on project risks, impacts, and mitigation measures. Such consultation should also allow the client to consider and respond to community inputs. Effective consultation:
* (i)	should be based on the prior disclosure of relevant and adequate information, including draft documents and plans
* (ii)	should begin early in the Social and Environmental Assessment process
* (iii)	must focus on the social and environmental risks and adverse impacts, and the proposed measures and actions to address these
* (iv)	must be carried out on an ongoing basis as risks and impacts arise. 

Consultation must be undertaken in a manner that is inclusive and culturally appropriate—tailoring the consultation process to the language preferences and decision-making process of the affected communities and to the needs of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups.

For projects with significant adverse impacts on affected communities, consultation must ensure their free, prior and informed consultation and facilitate their informed participation. Informed participation involves organised and iterative consultation, leading to the client’s incorporating into their decision-making process the views of the affected communities on matters that affect them directly (such as proposed mitigation measures, the sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues). The consultation must be documented—particularly the measures taken to avoid or minimise risks to and adverse impacts on the affected communities.

**Grievance Mechanism**

IFC mandates that clients respond to communities’ concerns. If anticipating ongoing risks to or adverse impacts on affected communities, the client must establish a grievance mechanism to receive and facilitate resolution of communities’ concerns and grievances. The grievance mechanism should be scaled to the risks and adverse impacts of the project. It should address concerns promptly using an understandable and transparent process that is culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the affected communities—at no cost and without retribution. The mechanism should not impede access to judicial or administrative remedies.
The client must inform the affected communities about the project grievance mechanism in the course of its community engagement process.

**Reporting**

In terms of external reporting, IFC requires clients to disclose to affected communities an Action Plan describing specific mitigation measures and actions necessary for the project to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of the Performance Standards. Clients must also provide periodic reports that describe progress with Action Plan implementation on issues that involve ongoing risk to or impacts on affected communities, and on issues of concern identified via the consultation process or grievance mechanism. These reports must also be in a format accessible to the affected communities and in a frequency proportionate to the concerns of affected communities (but not less than annually).


## PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions

Performance Standard 2 requires consultation to be carried out in cases where large-scale retrenchment is necessary (e.g. at the end of the project operation phase). In these cases, the client must ensure consultation with employees, their representative organisations and the government (where appropriate) in a manner that is absent of discrimination.
IFC PS 2 also stipulates the need for a grievance mechanism for workers (and their organisations, where they exist) to raise reasonable workplace concerns. This mechanism should involve an appropriate level of management and address concerns promptly, using an understandable and transparent process that provides feedback to those concerned, without any retribution. The mechanism should not impede access to other judicial or administrative remedies that might be available under law or through existing arbitration procedures, or substitute for grievance mechanisms provided through collective agreements. IFC obligates clients to inform their workforce of the grievance mechanism at the time of hire, and make it easily accessible to them.


## PS 3: Pollution Prevention and Abatement

Performance Standard 3 does not contain any specific provisions calling for community consultation/participation, disclosure, or grievance redrerdss


## PS 4: Community Health Safety and Security

Performance Standard 4 does not contain any specific provisions calling for community consultation/participation, disclosure, or grievance redress


## PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement

Performance Standard 5 also makes clear statements requiring consultation evidencing the informed participation of affected persons and communities in decision-making processes. It stipulates that consultation “will continue during the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of compensation payment and resettlement”. 

For instances of physical displacement, consultations must help clients to offer displaced persons choices among feasible resettlement options, and provide relocation assistance suited to the needs of each group of displaced persons—with particular attention to the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. Consultations are also necessary to inform clients’ determinations of relocation assistance that suffice to restore the standards of living of affected people and communities.

IFC also mandates that clients establish special grievance mechanisms for receive and addresses concerns specific to compensation and relocation.


## PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Management


For Performance Standard 6, the need for community consultation is understood as integral to defining an appropriate system of independent certification for the sustainable management of the resources.


## PS 7: Indigenous Peoples

Information disclosure, consultation and informed participation are key issues in IFC Performance Standard 7. When a project initiative will affect communities of Indigenous Peoples, the Client is to establish an ongoing relationship from as early as possible in the project planning and to maintain it throughout the life of the project. In projects with adverse impacts, the consultation process will ensure the free, prior, and informed consultation on affected communities of Indigenous Peoples and facilitate their informed participation on matters that affect them directly. Processes of community engagement must be culturally appropriate and commensurate with the risks and potential impacts to the Indigenous Peoples.

To ensure these aims, IFC mandates the following steps:
* involve Indigenous Peoples’ representative bodies (e.g. councils of elders or village councils, etc.)
* be inclusive of both women and men and of various age groups in a culturally appropriate manner
* provide sufficient time for Indigenous Peoples’ collective decision-making processes
* facilitate the Indigenous Peoples’ expression of their views, concerns, and proposals in the language of their choice, without external manipulation, interference, or coercion, and without intimidation
* ensure that the grievance mechanism is culturally appropriate and accessible for Indigenous Peoples

For projects affecting communities of Indigenous Peoples, IFC also requires clients to “seek to identify, through the process of free, prior, and informed consultation with and the informed participation of the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples, opportunities for culturally appropriate development benefits.” Such opportunities and benefits should be commensurate with the degree of project impacts, with the aim of improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to fostering the long-term sustainability of the natural resource on which Indigenous Peoples communities. The client must document identified development benefits and make them accessible to Indigenous Peoples communities in a timely and equitable manner.


## PS 8:	Cultural Heritage

Performance Standard 8 states that where a project may affect cultural heritage, clients must consult with affected communities who use, or have used within living memory, the cultural heritage for longstanding cultural purposes and must incorporate the views of the affected communities on such cultural heritage into the client’s decision-making process. Consultation will also involve the relevant national or local regulatory agencies that are entrusted with the protection of cultural heritage.&nbsp;
