In addition to the discussions filed here, I also once (2009 or so) compiled a fairly comprehensive [reference list of international laws affecting indigenous peoples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e3GNtRESh9awKXkk5S2Jmg4evH76RwtRp6fdvN-GqFw/edit?usp=sharing).  I don't actively maintain it.
