It obligates states to “enact legislation and promote such educational programs as may be calculated to secure the acceptance and observance of the policy.”
* Article 5 specifies that measures designed for the special protection of vulnerable populations shall not be deemed as discrimination, and enables state parties to establish such measures in consultation with representative employers’ and workers’ organizations.

Article 6 (paras. 2) Requires that programs of action to eliminate as a priority the worst forms of child labor shall be designed and implemented in consultation with relevant government institutions and employers' and workers' organizations, taking into consideration the views of other concerned groups as appropriate. 

### Convention on Biological Diversity [^CBD]

The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international legally binding treaty.[^CBD-parties] The Convention has three (3) main goals:

1) conservation of biological diversity;
2) sustainable use of its components;
3) fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.

Within the convention, the following passages relate to community consultation and participation:

#### Article 8:In-situ Conservation

Article 8(j) specifies that, subject to national legislation, party states must:

“respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices”.

This article carries with it the implicit requirement that for projects affecting indigenous and local communities, such communities need to be consulted with and studied regarding their practices of biodiversity conservation. Indigenous participation is critical not only in regards to gathering this information, but also in terms of deciding equitable recompense for the benefits accrued from the utilization of indigenous knowledge.

#### Article 14:	Impact Assessment and Minimizing Adverse Impacts

Article 14(c) notes that parties to the convention must promote informed consultation on activities that are likely to cause significant adverse impacts on the biological diversity of other States, or areas beyond the limits of their own national jurisdiction. Such promotion may be achieved by encouraging the negotiation of bilateral, regional or multilateral arrangements. 

#### Decisions of the Conference of Parties

In addition to the CBD itself, the Decisions of the Conference of Parties (COP) must also be taken into account—intended as they are to determine the policy, strategy and program priorities within the framework of the COP. 

At the Fifth Conference of Parties, a Decision [^CBD-decision-v16] was adopted reiterating the necessity of the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the development of guidelines for benefits sharing. In addition, the Decision clearly states that women and women’s organization must be fully incorporated in the consultation process and given full access to participation. To achieve these aims, the Decision mandates that various mediums of communications should be used to most effectively reach, inform, and include the views and concerns of target indigenous populations. The Decision also states that Indigenous People should be engaged to develop a register of knowledge on traditional practices and lifestyles relevant to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and about ways to strengthen legislation, customary practices and traditional systems of resource management and methods of protecting their knowledge against unauthorized use. It requires that women’s knowledge be of conservation and methods of sustaining biological diversity be specially documented and preserved. Finally, the Decision of the Fifth Conference of Parties states that Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be consulted and encouraged to participate in the development of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding any development proposed to take place on sacred sites and on lands or waters occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.
