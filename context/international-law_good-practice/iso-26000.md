### ISO 26000

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global federation of national standards bodies that develops voluntary ‘International Standards’ for efficient and effective industries.

ISO 26000 is an International Standard for ‘Social Responsibility’ approved in 2010. Addressing core subjects for social responsibility, ISO 26000 is not specific to any industry and can be applied by any entity aiming to understand and integrate social responsibility into its operations as part of a general sustainable development program. 

ISO 26000 defines the following seven (7) principles for social responsibility:

1) accountability;
2) transparency;
3) ethical behavior;
4) respect for stakeholder interests;
5) respect for the rule of law;
6) respect for international norms of behavior; 
7) respect for human rights.
