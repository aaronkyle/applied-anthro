### Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination [^ICERD]

The United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) is a second-generation human rights instrument that commits its members to the elimination of racial discrimination and the promotion of understanding among all races. The Government of Indonesia acceded to this convention on 25 Jun 19995 (with the reservation that it does not consider itself bound by the provision of Article 22).

While the ICERD itself does not contain specific requirements on community consultation, it establishes the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination6, and empowers it to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly. This Committee’s guidelines do contain disclosure and consultation provisions.
