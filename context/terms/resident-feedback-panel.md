A '''Resident Feedback Panel''' (RFP) is a questionnaire or form of survey, and a method of data collection usually implemented in areas with dense population densities (e.g. in a city). A pool of respondents within a given area is called upon to participate in quantitative and/or qualitative research surveys (e.g. telephone surveys or face-to-face interviews). The responses are then stored and analyzed over time to identify general trends in public perception.<ref name="Carson and Lyn, 2001">Carson, Lyn; Gelber, Katharine. 2001.

Parameters of an RFP include:

*participants are randomly selected from within a particular geographic area;
*participants may be pre-screened to identify sample profiles or representative groups;
*surveys can accommodate data from large numbers of people (up to several thousand);
*typically carried out over long periods, and implemented every 2-4 years;
*does not require participants to meet in person (e.g. written and telephone survey);
*progressively giving participants a greater understanding of the planning process over their period of involvement; and
*research findings being widely available.<ref name="Carson and Lyn, 2001" />


A resident feedback panel can involve a cross-selection of citizens, thus providing an element of representativeness in the recorded responses. It can help to track changes in community attitudes over a long period of time. However, to develop and maintain an RFP database requires long-term devotion of resources by the relevant government agency.  This method also assumes either a high degree of participant literacy or a high degree of connectivity to by telephone and upon the willingness of people to participate in the survey process, and care must be taken in how objectives are defined and to how the process is implemented.<ref name="Carson and Lyn, 2001" />
