'''Surveys''' are a good method for collecting information in a standardized form from groups of people using a questionnaire or interview. A small amount of information is usually gathered from a large number of people using set questions. Short categorized questions on key issues allow answers to be easily filled in, tabulated and analyzed. Surveys allow a statistically significant sample of information to be collected for comparison, to identify larger patterns and structures and to monitor change.<ref name="Payne et al 2004">Payne, Geoffrey; Majale, Michael (eds). 2004. The Urban Housing Manual: Making Regulatory Frameworks Work for the Poor. London: Earthscan.</ref>

The most reliable means of conducting a survey is face-to-face. In some cases or with regard to certain issues, surveys may also be conducted by telephone, through the mail, or via the Internet, though the use of indirect means for conducting a survey is highly context-dependent.<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

**Strengths:**<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

   * Good for gaining general socio-economic information about the participants e.g. household composition and structure, income, livelihood activities, access to and distribution of assets, ethnicity, membership of social organizations.
   * Effective for gaining broad picture of people’s views e.g. on policy issues.
   * Useful for collecting large samples of data for comparison and analysis.
   * Especially important for household or community level data where census data is not available.
   * Can be highly representative depending on sample size.
   * Responses can be immediately recorded.
   * Provides easy data standardization, aggregation and synthesis.
   * Collection of data can involve less qualified field researchers.

**Weaknesses:**<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

   * Smaller sample sizes may not be representative of the general population/target group.
   * Not good for understanding causal processes, meanings or perceptions.
   * Less useful when trying to capture views of minorities, due to standardized questions.
   * Can be extremely demanding of time and resources.


### Variations of Surveys

#### Household Survey

Household surveys were used extensively in the ‘Regulatory Guidelines for affordable shelter project’. Within the Lesotho study, household surveys “made it possible to determine, with considerable accuracy, the extent to which formal and customary systems regulate access to housing. By collecting socio-economic data it was possible to explore how interviewees’ levels of poverty influence their approaches to accessing land and what were the main constraints for different categories of households” (Hall, 2003).<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

However most research projects found that the household surveys on their own could not have addressed all the research questions raised. Methods of qualitative data collection, such as in-depth interviews and focus groups were also used by most teams. These provided invaluable information on people’s experiences and understandings which could not be accessed using a questionnaire survey.<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

#### Income-Expenditure Survey

#### Scanning Surveys

#### Detailed Surveys

#### Short Surveys

Unlike general surveys (where the sample group and the amount of questions are comparatively large—requiring also substantial organizational resources), short surveys focus on one narrowly defined issue, question or problem and focus of target groups and small representative samples [usually 25-70 cases]. Close-ended questionnaire design often helps to quantify responses for subsequent statistical analysis. Probability sampling is a common means of populating a sample group.

Short surveys can help to augment qualitative data from sources like key informant interviews, rapid rural appraisal or focus group discussions. The number of non-sampling errors also tend to be lower for short surveys. Short surveys are limited in how their results can credibly be generalized or extrapolated. Small sample sizes also limit their usefulness in statistical analysis.<ref name="Krishna Kumar">Kumar, Krishna. 1990 (rev. 2006). ''Conducting Mini Surveys in Developing Countries''.

#### Piloting questionnaires

It is usually advisable to test the design of your questionnaire through piloting. Testing your questionnaire among a smaller group of respondents can help determine whether the questions generate appropriate data for your research, and whether the questions are meaningful for the informants and appropriate to the context, especially in relation to cultural or linguistic issues. It can also help in deciding how the data will be recorded and analyzed, e.g. whether certain questions should be closed (a specific choice of answers) or open (where respondents can answer in their own words). Once the questionnaire has been tested, the design of the questionnaire can be adjusted or changed as appropriate.<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

#### Sampling

The are several ways of deciding who should be the respondents for questionnaire surveys. These include the random ‘lottery’ selection, geographical stratification and theoretical sampling. The sampling method chosen depends on the objectives of that stage of the research. To ensure the data collected is representative of the population as whole, random sampling may be used or households can be randomly selected from a map of the community. However it must be remembered that certain social, geographical and temporal aspects may impact on those who actually respond to the questionnaire. For instance if household questionnaires are undertaken during the day it may be more likely that female members of the household are at home.<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />

If however the research relies on gaining information from key population groups based on characteristics of wealth, gender, age, tenure status etc. more selective sampling methods are necessary. One example of this is ‘theoretical sampling’ (Burgess, 1992, p.209), whereby the choice of respondent is identified as someone who may have a perspective upon the themes and aims of the research. Which groups will be approached for their opinions can be decided after using such tools as a stakeholder analysis or well-being ranking. It is often important to use an aspect of selective sampling when it is important to ensure that minority groups, such as female-headed households, are included in a wider study.<ref name="Payne et al 2004" />
