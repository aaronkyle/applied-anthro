summary: : an intense period of design or planning.


A **charrette** (Fr: “little cart”) is an intensive planning process involving a dynamic and rapid interchange of ideas.

A charrette is normally held over a several days. The charrette sessions typically begin with facilitators introducing the problem context and working with participants to establish key topics and priority issues and define desired outcomes. On subsequent days, participants engage in open discussions around each issue&emdash;fleshing out associated issues, brainstorming ways that issues and be addressed, risks avoided, and problems resolved,. The final days of a charrette are used to transform participant ideas into concrete action plans.

Typical characteristics of a charrette include:<sup>[1]( "Carson and Lyn, 2001")</sup>

* being convened and facilitated by a project planning team;
* involving the general community or targeted interest groups via well-publicized public meetings;
* opening opportunities to participating in devising options and to assess related contingencies;
* taking place over and intensive multi-day period; and
* producing concrete planning proposals in a short period of time.

The charrette is a useful tool not only for the rapidity with which it can help to formulate concrete planning proposals, but also because the participatory process helps those involved to better understand the problem context and to appreciate the intricacies of propose action plans and the specific differences between various options and alternatives.<sup>[2]( "Carson and Lyn, 2001")</sup> The intensive interaction format, however, has limitation with respect to ensuring that the charrette resulting is truly ‘representative’ decision making, and attention must be paid to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable people and marginalized groups.
