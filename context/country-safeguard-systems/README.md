## What are country safeguard systems?

The term country safeguard systems (CSS) refers to aspects of a countryâ€™s legal and institutional framework that pertain to environmental and social safeguards. This includes laws, regulations, rules, and procedures, as well as national, subnational, or sectoral implementing institutions and agencies.

## What's the purpose of this repository?

I use this repository to bring together different lines of research that I have done on country safeguard systesms--and I'd appreciate any help and contributions to updating and improving this work.

## Am I working on other resources outside of this repository?

I have a few Google Spreadsheets under active development to track country laws.. primary with respect to social and environmental safeguards:

- [Country Safeguard Systes - INDONESIA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8GafqJBCvZxw_fFtfNvno826R0tT4HeoAks8Hf-Exk/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Country Safeguard Systes - INDIA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O-5ihGjPjPwTtcSxa3ADnSsUoKh1rreTpPgM6QrFwco/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Country Safeguard Systes - CHINA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTFmQVhZ0aZaMSQ3mtPd_x4YnJ-t95hWLdVS-9izePE/edit?usp=sharing)

I also have a few spreadsheets that I work on from time to time that collect a range of information on social development issues.  These I term 'country profiles' following the nomenclature of an initiative financed by the World Bank. These country profiles each have a specific theme. And (in line with my professional background), most focus on issues pertinent to Indigenous Peoples.

I am still opening access to many Google Sheets. If you find that a sheet is restricted, just request access...
