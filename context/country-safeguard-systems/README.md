## What are country safeguard systems?

The term country safeguard systems (CSS) refers to aspects of a countryâ€™s legal and institutional framework that pertain to environmental and social safeguards. This includes laws, regulations, rules, and procedures, as well as national, subnational, or sectoral implementing institutions and agencies.

## What's the purpose of this repository?

I use this repository to bring together different lines of research that I have done on country safeguard systesms--and I'd appreciate any help and contributions to updating and improving this work.

## Am I working on other resources outside of this repository?

I have a few Google Spreadsheets under active development to track country laws.. primary with respect to social and environmental safeguards.  I'll add links later.  You can always write to me if you're interested to collaborate.

I also have a few spreadsheets that I work on from time to time that collect a range of information on social development issues.  These I term 'country profiles' following the nomenclature of an initiative financed by the World Bank. These country profiles each have a specific theme. And (in line with my professional background), most focus on issues pertinent to Indigenous Peoples.
