## Government

Project operations will involve government bodies and agents from the national level to the local levels:

## National Government

The national government’s key interests in the WBN Project include revenue streams, enforcement of legislation, and sustainability of natural resources. WBN-backed community development initiatives can help to lessen the financial, developmental training and capacity-building burdens of the national government, and the project’s success may even have positive reputational consequences.

Sub-national Government
Sub-national government refers to the divisions of government at the provincial (propinsi), regency (kabupaten), and sub-district (kecamatan) levels. These units of sub-national government possess administrative authority in all matters other than those retained by the central government and the provinces—including health and safety, education and culture, environment, land affairs, agriculture, transportation, investment, public works, industry and trade, cooperatives and labour.
Similar to the national government, sub-national (or “local”) government authorities are interested in taxes, enforcement of legislation, and sustainability of natural resources, as well as general aspects of Project activity, including the provision and development of infrastructure (roads, schools, health clinics, etc. as described in the Community Development Plan [CDP]) and compensation payments (as outlined in the Compensation Framework).
