## Acceptability Assessment

Narrative findings regarding implementation effectiveness of elements of CSS subject to strengthening with respect to the following parameters as relevant to the safeguards triggered by the request for TA (environment, involuntary resettlement, Indigenous Peoples):: institutional capacity, process, outputs and outcomes (with concise case studies included as sidebars), (20-30 pages depending on number of safeguards included and complexity of the analysis)

A. Institutional Framework and Capacity of Implementing Agencies
B. Processes and Procedures
C. Outputs
D. Environmental and Social Outcomes of Other Donor and Non-donor Supported Projects
E. Findings of Acceptability Assessment

The purpose of Acceptability Assessment is to determine the implementation effectiveness of the CSS, based on the legal requirements of the CSS. Unlike the Equivalence Assessment which is primarily a desk study supplemented by interviews with experts in the field, the Acceptability Assessment can be expected to be primarily field based, taking the form of interviews with individuals and groups of stakeholders as well as site visits to selected projects as described below. A thorough review of secondary sources, published and unpublished literature on various aspects of CSSâ€™ implementation effectiveness, is an important part of the preparation for an Acceptability Assessment, so as not to duplicate recent work that has already been conducted and can most usefully inform the assessment.

### Institutional Capacity

For some parameters, such as institutional capacity, a narrative format,  supplemented by an organogram, may be useful for characterizing the structure,  authority, resources, expertise and experience of a particular CSS implementing  institution.

#### Identification Country / Agency Institutional Structure for CSS Implementation

List of DMC organizations (government ministries, departments and administrative units and the national and sub-national levels; or in the case of private sector projects, companies and financial institutions and supporting entities, such as contracts and consultants) that have primary authority and responsibility for implementation of CSS safeguard requirements

    *Data sources*: CSS legal framework, including not only the laws relating to the various safeguards but also in laws authorizing the establishment, designation and functions of government agencies and institutions.


#### Discussion of Institutional Capacity for CSS Implementation

(i) management that is accountable for CSS implementation;
(ii) sufficiency of staff capacity in terms number and quality in terms of education, training and expertise;
(iii) suitability of technical and physical resources (e.g. laboratory and data processing equipment, (e.g., vehicles); and
(iv) sufficiency financial resources sufficient to support staff, technical and physical resources as well as an adequate operating budget.


### Processes and Procedures

With respect to process and procedures, a flow chart format may be a useful way to demonstrate findings with regard to the coherence and transparency of the  environmental assessment or land valuation process.

#### Identification of Informal Processes and Procedures Normally Followed in CSS Implementation

This section notes any processes or procedures not mandated by law or regulation and describes their implementation in terms of consistency, coherence, efficiency and transparency.

    *Note*: Support assessment with stakeholder interviews. [ref^10]

### Outputs

To evaluate the content and analytical quality of Environment Impact  Assessment reports and Environmental Management Plans as well as  Resettlement Plans or Indigenous Peoples Plans, a matrix presentation is often  useful, using CSS legal requirements and guidance documents for benchmarking  purposes. [^33]

The case study approach, in a concise narrative sidebar format, is often a useful  way to convey outcomes in comparison to CSS objectives of legal requirements.

[33]: Because of the many variables involved in assessing the different criteria for Acceptability Assessment,, it appears that the matrix format may be more useful for the assessment of CSS requirements that are specified in a
checklist format, such as , the required content of an Environmental Impact Assessment or Environmental
Management Plan.

#### Review of Representative Outputs

    *For example*: three projects, in diverse sectors (e.g. energy, transport, industry)--ideally those that are subject to the legal requirements of the CSS but not subject to the safeguard systems of any development partner.

i). Depending on the safeguard under review, such outputs could include initial environmental assessments or rapid environmental assessment used for screening purposes, environmental impact assessments, environmental management and monitoring plans, public disclosure and consultation reports; environmental audits and compliance reports, resettlement action plans and audits, or Indigenous Peoples Plans.

ii.) Review should assess compliance with specific CSS legal requirements and for overall quality with respect to international good practice [ref^11]; this can be conducted in a matrix format.

### Outcomes

#### Assessment of Environmental and Social Outcomes

Acceptability assessment with respect to compliance with the applicable substantive (as distinguished from procedural) objectives of the CSS.

    *Note*: The methods normally used by ADB for supervision missions with respect to compliance with ADB safeguard conditions can provide a useful framework, with CSS safeguard conditions applicable to projects substituted for ADB safeguards. Identify the extent the CSS monitoring is linked to CSS safeguard requirements as documented in project permitting agreements and the degree to which such requirements have been met in practice along with the consequences of non-compliance (including incentive structure, enforcement mechanisms, remediation, compensation and punitive measures, such as fines, where applicable).
