## Action Plan

Recommend a series of CSS strengthening measures that if implemented, will bring the performance (outputs and outcomes) of the CSS into full compliance with the legal requirements of the CSS and the ADB 2009 SPS.  (1-2 pages)

*Note*: Such CSS strengthening measures could include enhancement of institutional capacity through recruitment of more qualified management and staff, reorganization of assignment functions; acquisition of appropriate technology; increased and improved allocations of funding; adoption of more coherent, efficient and transparent processes and procedures; better quality outputs and improved outcomes. Such measures should be conducive to technical assistance from development partners either directly or through intermediaries, including non-governmental organizations.
