### Illustrative Acceptability Indicators (Environment)

**Institutional Capacity**

* Does the institution have adequate authority in practice to require project proponents and other agencies to respect and comply with its legally authorized decisions?
    - Is the institutional structure of the implementing institution adequate to support its legal mandates?
    - Does the institution have an adequate annual budget to support its mandates?
    - Are technically competent management staff allocated to appropriate organizational units within the institution including HQ and field offices? Can the institution provide value-added from a technical stand point?
    - Is there sufficient continuity of personnel to maintain and expand institutional knowledge?
    - Does the institution have access to independent technical expertise as necessary to supplement its own technical expertise?
    - Does the institution have access to legal counsel regarding its critical mandates?
    - Does the institution have adequate equipment and mobility to support its mandates in an independent manner?

**Processes and Procedures**

* Are standard procedures sufficiently well designed to lead to intended outcomes?
* Are the procedures aligned with categorical determinations required by the legal framework?
46 Annex 5
* Are the procedures designed to take into account specific project characteristics or are they overly mechanical or deterministic?
* Are allowable processing times for project review and approval sufficient for adequate consideration of the critical issues ?
* Are there provisions for additional studies where necessary and appropriate?
* Are projects screened for potential impacts and risks in the appropriate time in the in the project design process, to influence to scope of environmental and social assessment, consistent with legal requirements?
* Are field-based surveys that employ qualified and experienced experts during environmental assessment used to identify physical cultural resources that may be at risk? Do projects provide for the use of “chance find” procedures that include a pre-approved management and conservation approach for materials that may be discovered during project implementation..
* Are there processes and procedures that are clear and practical to ensure and facilitate meaningful consultation with and informed participation of project affected people, including women, non-governmental organizations, early in the project preparation process so as to ensure that their views and concerns are made known to and understood by decision-makers and taken into account?
* Are consultation and related consultant procedures designed to facilitate ensure that such consultations continue throughout project implementation to as necessary to address issues related to project impacts?
* Are there practical mechanisms to ensure and facilitate the effective operation of legally mandated grievance mechanisms at the project-level?
* Is there a procedures to ensure that Are draft EAs and EMPs disclosed in a timely manner, as required by the legal framework, and in an accessible place and in a form and language(s) understandable to affected people and other stakeholders?
* Is there a procedure to ensure that the final environmental assessments, and their updates if any, disclosed to affected people and other stakeholders? Outputs: (as required by legal framework): e.g. Environmental Assessments (ESs) and Environmental Management Plans: (as required by legal framework):
* Do EAs address potential as well as probable and residual impacts within the project’s area of influence?
* Do EAs identify indirect, cumulative and induced, as well as direct impacts?
* Do EAs identify impacts and risks to physical, biological, and physical cultural resources?
* Do EAs identify socio-economic impacts (including impacts on livelihood through environmental media), in particular with respect to vulnerable groups and gender?
* Do EAs identify impacts and risks to health and safety of affected communities?
* Do EAs assessment potential trans-boundary and global issues where appropriate?
* Do EAs examine alternatives to a project’s location, design, technology and components and their potential environmental and social impacts at a sufficiently early stage in the EA process to influence project decision-making?. Do EAs examine the no project alternative? Do EAs document the rationale for selecting a particular alterative?
* Do project proponents prepare EMPs that include proposed mitigation measures, environmental monitoring and reporting requirements, related institutional or organizational arrangements, capacity development and training measures, implementation schedule,cost estimates, and performance indicators?
Annex 5 47
* Do EAs reference regulatory requirements on pollution control, such as emissions and effluent standards, and/or international standards, such as the World Bank Group Environment, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHSGs)?
* Do EMPs incorporate the polluter pays principle?
* Are draft EAs and EMPs disclosed in a timely manner, as required by the legal framework, and in an accessible place and in a form and language(s) understandable to affected people and other stakeholders?.
* Are the final environmental assessments, and their updates if any, disclosed to affected people and other stakeholders
* Are monitoring results of EMPs documented, including the development and implementation of corrective actions?
* Are EMP monitoring results disclosed?
* Are there recommended, sector-specific guidelines designed to implement legal requirements for pollution prevention and abatement? How do such guidelines compare with the EHSGs for the applicable project sector with respect to the EHSG’s recommended emissions and effluent limits as well as qualitative measure for pollution prevention and abatement.
* Are there recommended guidelines or incentive programs to encourage the adoption of cleaner production processes and good energy efficiency practices, including recommended practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
* Do projects Establish preventive and emergency preparedness and response measures to avoid, and where avoidance is not possible, to minimize, adverse impacts and risks to the health and safety of local communities?

**Project Outcomes**

* Do project alternatives identified during the EA process of projects pave the way for the avoidance or minimization of environmental impacts?
* Are critical habitats effectively avoided by project activities as required by the legal framework? To the extent that exceptions from such prohibitions are evident, do such exceptions comply with those permitted by the legal framework?
* For projects located in legally protected areas, is there evidence that additional programs are being implemented, if and as required by law, to promote and enhance the conservation aims of such protected areas?
* For projects located in other (non-legally protected) natural habitats, do projects comply with other mandatory conservation measures?
* Is a precautionary approach used with respect to the use, development and management of renewable natural resources?
* Do projects comply with regulatory standards and guidelines for pollution control and abatement?
* Do projects implement recommended guidelines or incentive programs to encourage the adoption of cleaner production processes and good energy efficiency practices, including recommended practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
* Do projects avoid the use of hazardous materials subject to international bans or phase-outs?
* Do project provide workers with safe and healthy working conditions and prevent accidents, injuries, and disease?
* Are “chance find” procedures for physical cultural resources that may be discovered during project implementation observed in practice?
