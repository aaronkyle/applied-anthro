**Additional Legislation Relevant for Compensation [in cases of economic displacement]:**

* The Electricity Act 2003
    - addresses major issues involved in generation, distribution, transmission and trading in power—including provisions for payment of compensation for damages. Complementary to the Electricity Act is the MOP (Ministry of Power) Guidelines 2015, which clarify the process of payment and establish the standards for negotiating compensation amount for damages.
* The Telegraph Act 1885
    - governs the use of wired and wireless telegraphy, telephones, radio communications and digital data communications. It gives the Government of India exclusive jurisdiction and privileges for establishing, maintaining, operating, licensing and oversight of all forms of wired and wireless communications. The Telegraph Act includes many provisions relevant to POWERGRID operations, including requirements to avoid sensitive environmental areas, to minimize impacts, to notify affected people about the project, and to establish a grievance redress mechanism.

## National Law in Context

### Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [LAA 1894]

The Land Acquisition Act, 1894, governed the process of land acquisition in India until the passing of LARR 2013. LAA 1894 allowed land acquisition for public purposes by a government agency from individual landowners after paying a government-determined compensation to cover losses incurred by landowners.

### National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy of 2007 [NRRP 2007]

The National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, 2007, was an early attempt to reform the 1894 Land Acquisition Act. NRRP 2007 is a policy and as such it is not legally binding.  Although a Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2007 to make NRRP into a binding law (Act), this Bill never passed. NRRP is similar in most respect to the subsequent LARR 2013 (discussed below).  

### Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 [LARR 2013]

The Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Act, 2013m regulates the process of land acquisition—defining rules and procedures for granting compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement. This Act is applicable to POWERGRID operations only where there is land acquisition (for the sub-stations).  LARR 2013 is a binding law and overrules LAA 1894.
