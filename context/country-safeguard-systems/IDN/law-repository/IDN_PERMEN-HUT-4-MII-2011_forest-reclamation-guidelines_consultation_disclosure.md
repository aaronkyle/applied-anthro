### Regulation of the Minister of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia No. 4/Menhut-ll/2011 re: Forest Reclamation Guidelines

SUMMARY

The law stipulates guidelines for forest reclamation, with a view to make possible the implementation of Article 51 number 6 Government Regulation Number 76/2008, which concerns forest reclamation in natural disaster areas.  The guidelines are meant to promote holistic mining activities, and stipulate that the basic principles of reclamation as presented in the guidelines be implemented as soon as possible, and not simply when the mining activities are finished. The guidelines provide reference points for actors engaged in forest reclamation in areas formerly used for forest utilization, and contain a number of requirements for public consultation and disclosure. The law contains several technical requirements on how forest reclamation licenses are to be issued and how forest reclamation is to be carried out, managed, evaluated and ended.

CONSULTATION

The requirements for consultation primarily concern the collection of data ahead of, during, and upon the end of forest reclamation activities. Some requirements also overlap with the requirements for disclosure, primarily in terms of assessment and evaluation of forest reclamation activities. Consultation is mainly required with and via various governing bodies, depending on whether the activities take place on a central or a regional level.

Articles 5 and 6 require actors to include primary and secondary data on the economic social condition of residents of the area, as well as from villages that may be affected by mining activities, in compiling the location inventory for the concerned forest area, which is to be used as baseline data for utilization. Factors accounted for will include demography, income levels and livelihood details, education level, community institutions, land ownership and community cultures. Article 22 further stipulates that analysis of the area’s biophysical and socio-economic condition shall form the basis of the technical design of the annual reclamation plan for every location.

Article 30 requires the implementation of forest reclamation to comprise both civil and vegetation techniques adjusted to the local conditions.

Article 51 includes a recommendation to prevent illegal grazing through the education and provision of livestock feed seed of the local population. While not a specific requirement for consultation, the provision promotes an educational outreach that implies interaction with the local population.

Articles 56-57 require the license holder to establish and continuously improve a Human Resources institution, which is to possess expertise in the field of forestry, agriculture, mining, soil, and other fields relating to forest reclamation. The provisions do not directly name public consultation as a requirement in relation to this institution, but consultation could be one of the responsibilities of this institution.

DISCLOSURE

Like the requirements for consultation, those applying to disclosure primarily concern the evaluation and assessment of forest reclamation activities and their implementation. Several technical requirements are detailed, such as what data will be contained in various reports and via what instance this data is to be reported and disclosed, depending on the level that activities take place.

Article 9 requires the results of analysis and evaluation of numeric and special data to be mapped on a reclamation plan, on a scale no smaller than 1:25,000, as a basis for a 5-year or annual reclamation plan.

Article 15 (2) requires as part of the preparation of the forest area the relocation and clearing of infrastructure no longer in use, as well as the installation of signs, prohibition and closing of the entrance to mine location.

Article 25 [sic! There are two Article 25. This refers to the second instance in the document] requires the minister/management of government or non-government institution to develop an information system and ensure the communication of national space layout suited to the requirements of the region.

Articles 27-28 [sic! There are two Articles 27 and 28. This refers to the second instances in the document] stipulates that the assessment of 5-year and annual forest reclamation plans shall be carried out by the Director General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry on behalf of the Minister. The Director General also gives recommendation should the necessary requirements be assessed as fulfilled, and the Minister of Technical, Governor or Regent/Mayor (according to their authority) is responsible for ratifying the assessed plans.

Article 55 requires the license holder to have a special organization to handle the forest reclamation, whose duties shall include establishing the maintenance, research, monitoring and reporting of all execution plans and efforts of forest reclamation.

Article 59 requires technical monitoring and assistance on forest reclamation implementation to be performed at least once a year, carried out on both the central and the regional level.

Article 68 specifies the usage of the result of technical monitoring and assistance as to check the development/progress of reclamation implementation and ensure compliance with the law. These results will be reported by the technical instance handling forestry affairs at the District/City level to the Governor cq. Head of Provincial Forestry Office, with a copy to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry; by the technical instance handling forestry affairs at the Provincial level to the Governor eq. Head of Provincial Forestry Office, with a copy to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry; and the results of technical monitoring and assistance by the Management Office of RFA will be reported directly to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry.

Article 69 requires assessment of the success of forest reclamation to be done every 5 years or a year before expiration of the license, to be carried out by a team coordinated by the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry. At the regional level, a team coordinated by the Provincial Technical Office that handles forestry carries it out. This provision may be relevant in terms of tracking documents that may be required to be publicly accessible.

Articles 72-3 require the system of control and observation on forest reclamation implementation to be measurable, reportable, and verifiable, and the results to be transparent and open for review. The implementation of this system of control must also be based on sufficient mapping/spatial data; the availability of database system of process documentation and activities output; and the availability of a monitoring results system. All data and information resulting from forest reclamation monitoring and observation are to be presented in numeric/textual, spatial, and visual forms.

Articles 74-75 require the implementation of observation with an MRV system to meet the following stages: a) Output observation/monitoring; b) Outcome observation/monitoring; c) Impact observation monitoring; and d) Benefit observation/monitoring. The license holder will also prepare satellite images with sufficient resolution of the forest area before the utilization takes place.

Article 76 requires the license holder to submit periodical reports of forest reclamation implementation to the Directorate General of Management Guidance for River Flow Area and Social Forestry, with copies to the Directorate General for Forest Planology [sic] of Ministry of Forestry; Directorate General of Mineral, Coal, and Geothermal, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources; the Provincial Technical Office that handles forestry; and the District/City Technical Office that handles forestry.

Articles 77-78 stipulate that the Forest Reclamation Report will consist of a Quarterly Report and an Annual Report, which aside from data on report format will contain SPAS data, photos of reclamation activities implementation, and a map with coordinates of reclamation acreage (scale 1:10,000). The license holder must also provide condition pictures/images of forest area borrow-use acreage from “the 0 year” up to the transfer/return of it.
