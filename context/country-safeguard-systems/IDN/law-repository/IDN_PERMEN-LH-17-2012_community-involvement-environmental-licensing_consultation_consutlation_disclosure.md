SUMMARY

The law ratifies the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from October 17, 2003, which is appended in its entirety. The requirements for public consultation and disclosure fall mainly on the relevant government entities. The opening articles of the law also declare that the Government of Indonesia will not be bound by Article 26 (1) of the Convention, which obliges ratifying governments to pay into an Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund. This provision is granted by Article 26 (2) of the Convention.

Article 2 defines intangible cultural heritage as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills  - as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith - that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history; and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.” This intangible cultural heritage is manifested, among other things, in oral traditions and expressions (including language as a vehicle of intangible cultural heritage); performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; and traditional craftsmanship.

Article 6 requires the election of States Members of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage [the Committee] to abide by the principles of equitable geographical representation and rotation. These States Members are also required to choose only persons with appropriate qualifications in the various fields of intangible cultural heritage as their representatives.

Article 14 requires each State Party to endeavor, by all appropriate means, to:
