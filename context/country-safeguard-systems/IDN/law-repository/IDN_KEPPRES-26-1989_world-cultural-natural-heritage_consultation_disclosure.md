### Presidential Decree (Keppres) No. 26 of 1989 re:  Ratification of the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage

SUMMARY

The law ratifies the UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage from November 23, 1972, in its entirety. The Convention was established in recognition of the growing threat of destruction faced by cultural and natural heritage sites, and places certain demands on State Parties for consultation and disclosure in relation to the protection of cultural and natural heritage sites.

CONSULTATION

The UNESCO Convention does not contain a large amount of requirements for public consultation. Instead, it calls for State Parties to promote knowledge and appreciation of natural and cultural heritage among their populations. While the Convention does not contain any direct requirements levied on any entities outside of State Parties, the requirements listed here could be of relevance for entities engaging with State Parties in areas where natural and cultural heritage is concerned or located.

Article 5 (a) and (e): In order to ensure that effective and active measures are taken to protect, conserve and present cultural and natural heritage, the Convention requires state parties, to the extent possible, to adopt a general policy that provides a function for the cultural and natural heritage in the life of the community. The protection of identified heritage will be integrated into comprehensive planning programs, and the protection, conservation and presentation of cultural and natural heritage is to be fostered through training at national or regional training centers that also encourage scientific research in the field.

Article 8 and 10: The Convention also establishes an Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of Cultural and Natural Heritage of Outstanding Universal Value (the Committee). The election of its members shall ensure equitable representation of the different regions and cultures in the world.  This Committee may at any time invite public or private organizations or individuals for consultation on particular issues related to cultural and natural heritage.

Article 21 states that before granting international assistance to State Parties, the Committee shall carry out studies and consultations that it deems necessary for a decision to be made.

Article 27 requires each State Party to strengthen the appreciation and respect by their peoples of identified cultural and natural heritage by all appropriate means, particularly through educational programs.

DISCLOSURE

While the Convention does not contain any specific requirements for public disclosure, it does require State Parties to keep up-to-date and publish lists of all identified natural and cultural heritage.

Article 11 requires each State Party to the Convention to compile an inventory of its natural and cultural heritage, on the basis of which the Committee will compile, publish and keep up to date a World Heritage List. Inclusion of property on this list requires the consent of concerned State Parties, and the list is to be updated and distributed every two years. When necessary, the Committee will also compile and keep up to date a list of endangered world heritage, which will include the costs of operations required to safeguard the threatened heritage.

Article 13 states that the Committee shall publish and keep up to date a list of property for which international assistance for State Parties has been granted.

Article 27 requires State Parties to keep their publics informed of the threats faced by its cultural and natural heritage.
