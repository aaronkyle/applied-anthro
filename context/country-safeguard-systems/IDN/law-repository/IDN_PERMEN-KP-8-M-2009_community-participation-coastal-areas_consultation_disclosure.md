### Regulation of the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries No. Per.08/Men/2009 re: Community Participation and Empowerment in the Management of Coastal Areas and Small Islands

SUMMARY

The law provides requirements for community empowerment and participation in the management of resources associated with coastal areas and small islands, also called PWP-3-K. The community empowerment as stipulated in the law is geared towards improving community welfare, and the law contains specific provision on the manner in which this empowerment is to be executed in the various stages of the PWP-3-K, and nearly every article contains requirements for public consultation and disclosure.

CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

The requirements for public consultation and disclosure largely overlap, as the law is focused on community empowerment, and they are therefore treated jointly. The law provides specific requirements and general recommendations for the improvement and execution of community empowerment, and requirements are made of the government, the regional government(s), and business entities. The law is geared towards providing a legal basis to ensure the empowerment and participation of the community in the management of coastal and small islands resources.

Article 1 provides definitions for terms relevant to the law.

Management of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (PWP-3-K) is defined as a process of planning, utilization, supervision, and control of coastal and small island resources, with the aim to improve the welfare of the community.
Community Empowerment is defined as “the provision of facilities, encouragement, or assistance by the central or regional governments to the community so that they are able to determine the best option in making use of coastal and small island resources in a sustainable manner.”
Community Participation is defined as “the involvement of the community, physically or non-physically, and directly or indirectly, on the basis of self-consciousness or as the result of coaching in the management of coastal areas and small islands.”
Community is defined as “the community consisting of customary community groups, local community people, and traditional community people living in coastal areas and small islands.”
The main stakeholders are named as “the users of coastal and small island resources that have a direct interest in optimizing the utilization of coastal and small island resources, such as traditional fishers, modern fishers, fish farmers, tourism entrepreneurs, fishery entrepreneurs, and coastal community people.”
Social Institution is defined as “an existing institution that is voluntarily formed by local community members as needed and is a government and/or regional government partner to participate in the management of coastal areas and small islands.”

Article 2 defines the scope of applicability of the law, which comprises community participation in the planning, implementation, and supervision of PWP-3-K, as well as community empowerment in PWP-3-K.

Article 3 stipulates that community empowerment and participation is intended as a reference for the government, regional governments, and major stakeholders. The article further lists the purposes of this empowerment and participation as to:

a.  improve the effectiveness and sustainability of the utilization of coastal areas and
b.  apply the knowledge and skills of the community in the PWP-3-K;
c.  ensure and protect the interests of the community;
d.  realize the independence of the community in order to be able to participate, make efforts, and work either independently or collectively; and
e. improve the welfare of the community.

Articles 4 and 5 stipulate that the community is to be given an opportunity to participate in the stages of planning, implementation, and supervision of the PWP-3-K. The community participation is to be conveyed through social institutions in public consultations and/or customary formal/non-formal deliberations to the government and/or regional governments, and community participation in the planning stage will be in the form of:

	a. identifying the potentials and problems of the PWP-3-K;
	b. providing information in the planning of the utilization of coastal areas and small islands;
	c. providing input in determining the direction and planning of the PWP-3-K; and
	d. submitting feedback/suggestions on the plans of the PWP-3-K utilization.

Article 6 states that the form of community participation in the implementation of the PWP-3-K may be carried out in accordance with the type of activities, given as:

Article 7 states that the community participation in the supervision of the PWP-3-K is to be conveyed through social institutions to the key stakeholders in the utilization of coastal regions and small islands. If this cannot be resolved, the article states, “the relevant social institutions shall file the complaints to the authority.” Community participation in supervision will be in the form of:

	a. providing information or reports in the implementation of the utilization of the PWP-3-K;
	b. submitting reports and/or complaints for damages incurred related to the implementation of the PWP-3-K; and

Article 9 requires the federal and regional governments to empower the community to improve its welfare through activities in the field of management of coastal and small island resources to realize, develop, and improve community awareness of and responsibility for the PWP-3-K. These activities include conservation; reclamation; rehabilitation; education and training; research and development; cultivation; fishery business; organic farming; animal husbandry; and tourism.

Article 10 stipulates that community empowerment in decision-making will be carried out by providing direction and guidance in deliberations, both formal and non-formal, which will be submitted via social institutions to the government or regional government. Community empowerment in the implementation of management is carried out by integrating the types of activities undertaken by the key stakeholders involved. In partnerships between the community, businesses, and federal/regional government, the execution of this empowerment include:

Article 13 requires the government and regional governments to monitor and evaluate community participation and empowerment in the PWP-3-K. This monitoring will include planning and implementation activities, and achievement of results. This monitoring and evaluation will be taken into consideration in future participation and community empowerment.
