In conducting the study, it is necessary to take into account direct and/or indirect impact. Direct impact is defined as impact directly resulted from business and/or activity; indirect impact occurs as the result of change in certain environment component and/or primary business or activity due to presence of business and/or activity plan. In connection with this, it is necessary to consider the mechanism of impact flow in various environmental components, among others:
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural and community health components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on geophysical-chemical-biological components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural, and community health components, a series of further impact consecutively on geophysical-chemical and biological components;
activity resulting in direct important impact on social, economical, cultural, and community health components, a series of further impact consecutively on biological, social, economical, cultural and community health components;
important impacts take place in chain among social, economical, cultural and community health components as well as geophysical-chemical and biological components;
important impacts in items a through e which have previously been discussed result in adverse impact on business and/or activity plan.

Should the business and/or activity plan be in a stage of selection of component alternatives (such as location, equipment usage etc), a study will be carried out for each identified alternative.
A summary of the theoretical basis used in evaluation, as well as assumptions adopted, procedures, results of calculations, may be enclosed as supporting evidence.

The document shall also contain a Holistic Evaluation on Environmental Impact. In this section, the EIA document composer shall describe the results of evaluation/study of the interconnection and interaction of every identified hypothetical important impact. The impact evaluation method used shall be the same as the one set forth in the TOR Document. If the EIS study provides several component alternatives of the business and/or activity plan, this section shall contain a detailed recommendation of the best possible option, and a description of the basis of the recommendation.
