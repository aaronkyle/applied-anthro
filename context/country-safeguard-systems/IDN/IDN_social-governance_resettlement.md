**Social Regulatory Authorities.**

With respect to social impacts, in particular land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) for project-affected families, authority resides primarily at the State and local levels.

51. With respect to land acquisition for the construction of sub-stations, four state-level agencies participate in the basic structure of land administration: [^47]

(1) The Land Revenue Department maintains the textual database for land records as well as tax registers;
(2) The Survey and Settlement Department is responsible for maintaining spatial data, mapping and demarcating boundaries, and executing surveys on demand;
(3) The Department of Stamps and Registration is responsible for registering deeds and for collecting stamp duty due on transactions; and
(4) Municipal corporations or Panchayats maintain a property tax register and in some cases also maps, layout plans or city surveys outside of agricultural areas

52. Of the four agencies, the Land Revenue Department is the key institution, with considerable field presence dating back to pre-independence. At the District level its functions are overseen by the District Collector who is the key counterpart for POWERGRID in all land transactions as well as R&R. However, due to the gradual decline in the importance of land revenue as a source of government income (from 30% in the late 1950s to less than 2% in the late 1980s, the state Revenue Departments have been burdened with other mandates unrelated to land administration.

53. The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) is the responsible authority for all development projects involving displacement of 500 or more families in plain areas or 250 or more families in hilly areas. MRD is responsible, through the offices of the R&R Commissioner and Administrator for R&R Planning and Implementation for implementing the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affect Families, issued in 2004. In addition, there are state agencies responsible for the implementation of state laws and policies on R&R, specifically for the States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. With respect to land acquisition, which is required in the case of sub-stations, though not transmission lines (TLs), POWERGRID is obliged to apply for authorization to the state District Collector under the Terms of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and the DC plays a significant role in allocating and disbursing compensation to project affected families.

54. Of the four agencies, responsible for land acquisition the Land Revenue Department is the key institution, with considerable field presence dating back to pre- independence. At the District level its functions are overseen by the District Collector who is the key counterpart for POWERGRID in all land transactions as well as R&R. However, due to the gradual decline in the importance of land revenue as a source of government income (from 30% in the late 1950s to less than 2% in the late 1980s, the state Revenue Departments have been burdened with other mandates related to land administration. The expanded mandate of the Revenue Department, noted above, has resulted in a growing gap between demand for public services and the Department's ability to meet the demand in a timely manner. This has had the effect of increasing the costs for routine transactions such as copies of Records of Rights which is equivalent to a land title in India and to discretionary and sometimes corrupt behavior on the part of local revenue officials.[^48] The Bank's report recommends that in addition to promoting the adoption of modem digitized technological tools for use by the Revenue Department that expanding the number of trained surveyors is necessary for the Survey and Settlement Department. Based on pilot projects, it appears that this objective can be accomplished at little cost through technical training of village youth with the collaboration of self-help groups.

55. With respect to projects affecting Indigenous Peoples, per the requirements of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of the Rights) Act of 2006 the responsible governmental authority resides at the State level in State Level Monitoring Committees and at the District and Sub-divisional level Committees to be established under the Act under the ultimate authority of the central Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The committees are to include representatives of the Departments of Revenue, Forest and Tribal Affairs of the State governments. In addition, where applicable, the Ministry of Panchayats, the authority for implementation of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) have authority for specified impacts of projects on Indigenous Peoples to the extent that PESA is applicable.
