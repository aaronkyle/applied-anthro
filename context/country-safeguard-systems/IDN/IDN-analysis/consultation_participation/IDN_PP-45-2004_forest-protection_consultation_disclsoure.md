### Government Regulation (PP) No. 45 of 2004 re: Forest Protection

SUMMARY

The law is aimed at enhancing the legal provisions from previous legislation on forest protection as a part of forestry. It contains provisions for the protection of forest areas from human impacts, livestock and natural disasters, which require consultation with public communities.

CONSULTATION

The direct requirements for public consultation are exclusively directed towards communities living in or in proximity with the concerned forest areas. Consultation is aimed towards preventing and mitigating damage to the forest areas, and requirements are aimed at both government entities and permit holders.

Article 1 makes the following definitions relevant to public consultation:

Forest protection comprises efforts to prevent and control forest damage, forest areas and forest products, and to maintain the state, community and individual rights to the usage of the forest, forest area, forest products, investments and apparatus for forest management.
A community is an individual, a group of people or a customary law community constituting a legal entity.
The Minister is the Minister who handles the tasks and responsibilities in the forestry field.

Article 4 states that the Minister shall specify a special objective for forest protection in the contexts of research and development, education and training, or culture and religion. The forest protection for each identified special objective may be delegated to an institution executing each activity.

Article 7 states that to implement forest protection as defined in Article 1 in the context of human impact, the Government, Regional Government and the Communities shall:

Conduct socialization and counseling of law and regulations in the field of forestry.
Conduct an inventory of identified problems.
Support the improvement of community productivity.
Facilitate the establishment of community institution.
Improve the community’s participation in activities of forest management.
Cooperate with holders of permits or rights.
Improve the effectiveness of forest protection activity coordination.
Support the creation of alternative community occupation.
Improve the effectiveness of forest security disturbance reporting and response.
Implement sanction against transgression.

Article 8 states that the execution of forest protection shall be the responsibility of the pertinent permit holder for forest areas that have become areas for work, environmental service, forest product exploitation and collection, and areas for borrowing and utilization. For forest areas whose management is delegated to state-owned enterprises, forest protection is the responsibility of the manager of that enterprise. This forest protection shall comprise:

Securing the working area concerning forest, forest area and forest products, including flora and fauna.
Preventing forest damage due to human impact, livestock damage, forest fires, pests and diseases, and natural disasters.
Making the first response to the disturbance of forest security in the working areas.
Reporting each transgression to the nearest forestry institution.
Providing infrastructure and forest security staff as required/needed.

Article 9 states that the execution of forest protection for areas delegated to customary law communities will be the responsibility of those communities. This forest protection will follow the traditional norms of the community, under the pertinent customary law.

Article 10 for “rights forests”, the execution of forest protection is the responsibility of the rights holder. These activities include, among other things, cooperating with the owner of forest concession rights, forest area management, forest exploitation permit holders, collection permit holder and the public communities.

Article 11 states that the central, provincial and regency/city governments shall provide facilitation, guidance and supervision towards the forest protection activities as defined in Articles 8 to 10.

Article 15 states that to protect forest areas from livestock disturbance, an area of the production forest may be specified or closed for livestock shepherding by the head of the forest management unit, with further provisions to be regulated based on a Ministerial Decree.

Article 16 states that efforts to protect forest areas from natural disasters in the form of volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, storms, droughts, and earthquakes, must involve cooperation with the related institutions as well as counseling the community to improve awareness.

Article 23 requires national, provincial and regency/city governments to include community counseling and partnership standards in efforts to prevent forest fires, and exercise guidance and supervision.

Article 24 requires each permit holder for forest exploitation, forest area usage, owners of forest concession rights and/or heads of forest management units to include, in their efforts to extinguish forest fires, the empowerment of all existing resources and mobilization of the community to accelerate extinguishing. This also includes coordinating with the related institutions.
