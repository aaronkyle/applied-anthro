## Presidential Decree No. 78/2007 re: Ratification Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (Convention for the Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage)

SUMMARY

The law ratifies the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from October 17, 2003, which is appended in its entirety. The requirements for public consultation and disclosure fall mainly on the relevant government entities. The opening articles of the law also declare that the Government of Indonesia will not be bound by Article 26 (1) of the Convention, which obliges ratifying governments to pay into an Intangible Cultural Heritage Fund. This provision is granted by Article 26 (2) of the Convention.

Article 2 defines intangible cultural heritage as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills  - as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith - that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history; and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. For the purposes of this Convention, consideration will be given solely to such intangible cultural heritage as is compatible with existing international human rights instruments, as well as with the requirements of mutual respect among communities, groups and individuals, and of sustainable development.” This intangible cultural heritage is manifested, among other things, in oral traditions and expressions (including language as a vehicle of intangible cultural heritage); performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; and traditional craftsmanship.

CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE

As the requirements for consultation and disclosure detailed in the ratified Convention largely overlap, they are here treated jointly. While requirements to public consultation and disclosure are not numerous in the Convention, the ones that are stipulated are of importance for the implementation of the Convention. These requirements are mainly aimed at State Parties to the Convention, as well as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Article 1 defines the purposes of the convention as:
(a) to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage;
(b) to ensure respect for the intangible cultural heritage of the communities, groups and individuals concerned;
(c) to raise awareness at the local national and international levels of the importance of the intangible cultural heritage, and of ensuring mutual appreciation thereof;
(d) to provide for international cooperation and assistance.

Article 2 (3) defines ’Safeguarding’ as “measures aimed at ensuring the viability of the intangible cultural heritage, including the identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission, particularly through formal and non formal education, as well as the revitalization of the various aspects of such heritage.”

Article 6 requires the election of States Members of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage [the Committee] to abide by the principles of equitable geographical representation and rotation. These States Members are also required to choose only persons with appropriate qualifications in the various fields of intangible cultural heritage as their representatives.

Article 14 requires each State Party to endeavor, by all appropriate means, to:

(a) ensure recognition of, respect for, and enhancement of the intangible cultural heritage in society, in particular through:
(1) educational awareness-raising and information programs, aimed at the general public, in particular young people;
(2) specific educational and training programs within the communities and groups concerned;
(3) capacity-building activities for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage, in particular management and scientific research; and
(4) non-formal means of transmitting knowledge;
(b) keep the public informed of the dangers threatening such heritage, and of the activities carried out in pursuance of this Convention;
(c) promote education for the protection of natural spaces and places of memory whose existence is necessary for expressing the intangible cultural heritage.

Article 15 requires each State Party to endeavor to ensure the participation of communities, groups and, where appropriate, individuals that create, maintain and transmit intangible cultural heritage in the management thereof, within the framework of safeguarding activities.

Article 29 requires the State Parties to submit periodical reports on the legislative, regulatory and other measures taken for the implementation of the Convention to the Committee.
