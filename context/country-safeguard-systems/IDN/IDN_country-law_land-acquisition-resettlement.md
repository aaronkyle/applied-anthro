# Land Acquisition Practices in Indonesia under Law 2 of 2012


Indonesia enacted Law 2 of 2012 on Land Acquisition for Development in the Public Interest (Land Acquisition Law) for acquiring land for public use activities together with the implementing regulations.<sup>[1]( "The implementing regulations are: Presidential Decree (Perpres) 71 of 2012, which has been amended by Perpres 40 of 2014, Perpres 99 of 2014, Perpres 30 of 2015 and the most updated one, Perpres 148 of 2015; Minister of Finance Decree 13/PMK.02 of 2013 and 246/PMK.06 of 2014; Minister of Home Affairs Decree 72 of 2012; and Head of Land Office Decree 5 of 2012 and 6 of 2015.")</sup>  

The Land Acquisition Law provides clear, time-bound procedures with the objective to accelerate land acquisition. The scope of application of this law, however, is limited to eminent domain for public projects. Any private sector project involving land acquisition is still subject to prior policies, laws, and regulations, unless the government specifically designates the project to be a development project in the public interest, as regulated in the Presidential Decree (Perpres) 30 of 2015.

Law 2 of 2012 has significantly improved Indonesia’s country safeguards system (CSS) for involuntary resettlement by providing greater protection for the rights of property owners through requirements on stakeholder consultation and involvement as well as through feasible and just compensation or indemnification. Law 2 of 2012 provides several forms of compensation including resettlement of displaced property owners. Although the law deals with compensation for non-titled property holders where land acquisition is required, it cannot be applied to cases where there is no acquisition, such as when the land is publically owned. In such cases, the land would be cleared according to Law 5 of 1960, of which Article 18 states very clearly that land may be expropriated or taken by the government for public use activities by providing reasonable compensation in accordance to the procedures stipulated in the law, which compensate other assets.

5.	Under Law 2 of 2012, preference of the form of compensation is cash compensation instead of resettlement. When resettlement is selected as a form of compensation, technical guidelines for preparing, implementing, and managing a resettlement program need to be improved in order to meet the national standard and best international practices<sup>[2]( "Directive policies were developed and issued for specific projects with special conditions. In 2005, GoI has issued President Regulation No. 1 Year 2015 to address and manage social community impacts resulting from Jati Gede Reservoir development. Previously, West Java Government issued a Decision No. 61.1/Kep.1086/AdmRek/2012 in September 11, 2012 to address environmental and social issues resulting from land acquisition and displacement of Jati Gede. However, the attempts failed due to MoF blocked the budget. In the case of Normalization of Ciliwung River, Governor of Jakarta issued a Governor Regulation No. 163/2012, which gives the Provincial Government of Jakarta to implement land eviction. For Ciliwung River Normalization, however, implementation of the directive policy has been challenged by some displaced persons. The land eviction implementation has been accused violating the rights of displaced persons.")</sup>. 

The agencies or institutions that are eligible to acquire land through Law 2 of 2012 are any state, institution, ministry and non-ministry government institution, provincial government, district or city government, and state-owned legal entity/state-owned entity that are specially assigned by the Government.<sup>[3]( "Beside Law 2 of 2012 and its implementing regulations, there are other regulations related to the land acquisition and resettlement for public interest, such as Presidential Degree 40 of 2016 concerning the Acceleration of the Development of Electricity Infrastructure, which has significant aspects in reducing the time of land acquisition process and determining the location.  This would be discussed more in the section on Energy Sector.")</sup>  The government can also acquire land by establishing cooperation with state-owned enterprises, regional government owned enterprises, and private enterprises (public-private partnership).


## Land Acquisition Process in Accordance with Law 2 of 2012

The land acquisition stages as regulated in the law are: planning, preparation, implementation, and results delivery. The law specifies the institutions responsible for each stage. Figure A.10.1 illustrates the stages of land acquisition and the timing defined for each step. Figure A.10.1 also accounts for the provisions of Presidential Decree 148 of 2015, which has reduced the time needed for the land acquisition process to enhance the development of infrastructure. Details of each stage of the land acquisition are further elaborated below.

### Planning Stage


In this stage, the agency needing land shall make a Plan of Land Acquisition in the Public Interest in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Specifically, preparation of the plan shall refer to laws on regional planning, spatial planning, as well as to the development priority as stated in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, the Country Strategic Plan, as well as the Working Plan of relevant agencies.

The Land Acquisition Plan in the Public Interest Document should contain: (i) objectives and purpose of the development plan; (ii) a statement on its consistency with the Regional Spatial Plan and the National or Regional Development Plan; (iii) location of the land; (iv) size of the land needed by the project; (v) a general description of the land status; (vi) the estimated period of the implementation of land acquisition; (vii) the estimated period of the implementation of construction; (viii) estimated land value; and (ix) a budget. The plan shall be prepared under a feasibility study made in accordance with the laws and regulations.  The last step of the stage is submission of the Land Acquisition Plan in the Public Interest Document to the governor with complete supporting documents.

There is no time limit for an agency to prepare the Land Acquisition Plan in the Public Interest Document during the planning stage. 


### Preparation Stage

In the preparation stage, the responsible stakeholders for the activities are the agency that needs the land and the local government. After the agency submits the Land Acquisition Plan in the Public Interest Document, the governor establishes a project preparation team. This team, under governor instruction, implements preparation steps, the output of which is the issuance of the penetapan lokasi (determination of location) by the governor or regent (depending on the project scope). The steps of this stage are:

1.	Giving information about the planned development;
1.	Collecting initial data on the planned development;
1.	Public consultation concerning the planned development; 
1.	Development of the study team;
1.	Determination of location (penetapan lokasi);
1.	Disclosure of the penetapan lokasi pembangunan: printed and placed at the Kelurahan office and announced in local papers and via electronic media; and
1.	State administrative lawsuit.

The preparation stage is critical in land acquisition. The issuance of the penetapan lokasi requires agreement of the entitled parties and affected communities. Agreement should be provided by all entitled parties in writing. In many cases, the agency needing land has already been in close coordination with the local government since the planning stage in order to streamline the preparation process and to minimize rejection of entitled parties or affected communities.

Local governments apply different practices to guarantee that all steps would be achieved within the time limit. 


### Implementation Stage

MASP/NLA is the agency primarily responsible for the land acquisition activities in the implementation stage, although this responsibility may be delegated to the district land office.  Implementation of land acquisition is conducted by the Land Acquisition Committee (LAC) established by the regional MASP/NLA. The output of this stage is the compensation payment and the Land Release to the land office. The steps of this stage are:

1.	Development of the implementation team;
1.	Delegation to the local land office;
1.	Development of the implementation team at local land office;
1.	Inventory and identification;
1.	Disclosure of inventory and identification results;
1.	Filing any objection;
1.	Verification;
1.	Determination of appraiser;
1.	Valuation of compensation;
1.	Discussion of compensation;
1.	Validation;
1.	Lawsuit of the compensation;
1.	Compensation payment;
1.	Court-administered Trust Account (Konsinyasi);
1.	Data documentation; and
1.	Valuation of compensation 

An individual or group of independent appraisers carries out the valuation of compensation during the implementation stage. As regulated in Law 2 of 2012 and its supporting regulations, the valuation of the compensation should be done by “Independent and Professionals Appraisers who have license from Ministry of Finance as Public Appraiser and registered in National Land Institution (BPN).”  The Indonesian Society of Appraisers (Masyarakat Profesi Penilai Indonesia, MAPPI) has issued Valuation Standard 306, Valuation in the Context of Land Acquisition for Development for Public Interest, in response to Law 2 of 2012. The standard has the same principles as the law, which determines that the amount of compensation is based on the principles of humanity, fairness, usefulness, certainty, transparency, agreement, participation, welfare, harmony, and sustainability.


### Valuation of Compensation

The most critical issue in land acquisition is compensation. The amount of compensation is associated with the valuation of land acquisition objects. In the past, the valuation of land was based on the government tax assessment value (Nilai Jual Obyek Pajak – NJOP), which is much lower than the land market rate.  The Presidential Regulation 65 of 2006 on Land Acquisition for the Development in the Public Interest stipulates that independent appraisers are involved to calculate compensation, but such was limited to lost land. Compensation for structures and trees/plants were based on the Pricing Standard on Building and Plants, issued by the local government. 

Law 2 of 2012 on Land Acquisition ensures replacement value for the compensation so that the entitled parties losing their land and non-land assets for the project are able to live better. The law states that compensation should be reasonable and fair compensation should be given to the entitled party in exchange for land acquisition.  The principle of justice under the law emphasizes that land acquisition guarantees any reasonable reward or compensation to the entitled parties so that they have opportunity to live better.   

The land acquisition objects for the compensation include physical and economical losses:  

1. Land
1. Space above and underground 
1. Buildings
1. Plants
1. Objects attached to the land; and/or
1. Other losses that can be assessed. Other appraisable loss means nonphysical loss equivalent to money value, for example, loss due to lost business or jobs, moving cost, profession change, and remaining assets value. 

The above provisions are consistent with valuation concept in the compulsory land acquisition. In the valuation concept of compulsory land acquisition, the buyer (in this case, the government) has to pay higher than the market value.  And the seller (the entitled parties or property owners) do not release the land acquisition objects unless proper compensation is received. This law automatically eliminates the use of NJOP (tax assessment value), which has been an obstacle to provide proper compensation to land owners in the past.

The Land acquisition law mandates the appraiser to determine the amount of compensation at the time of announcement of the location determination (penetapan lokasi). Violation of this obligation shall make the appraiser liable to administrative sanction and/or criminal sanction. If there is delay in the delivery of compensation payment, the compensation amount has to include the cost of delays. 

As noted above, the Indonesian Society of Appraisers (MAPPI) has established a regulatory framework for vulation of compensation: Valuation Standard 306, “Valuation in the Context of Land Acquisition for Development for Public Interest.” 

The MAPPI standard emphasizes fair replacement value (nilai penggantian wajar), meaning the value for the benefit of the owner which will be based on the market value of a property, with special attention to elements of non-physical losses of property ownership  caused the taking of property rights .  The MAPPI standard includes a valuation method for compensation for physical and nonphysical loss. Physical loss includes land, space above and underground, buildings, and plants, while compensation for nonphysical loss includes the following: 

*	Compensation on disposal rights of landowners, which will be given a premium, and which are measured in terms of money under the provisions of the legislation in force. The substitutions may include matters related to: (i) loss of a job or the loss of business, including change of the profession (with respect to Law 2 of 2012, Article 33 (f) of the elucidation); (ii) emotional loss (solatium), which is an intangible losses associated with the acquisition of land use as the residence of the owner (with due regard to Law 2 of 2012, Article 1 paragraph 10; Article 2 of the elucidation; and Article 9, paragraph 2).
*	Cost of transaction, which may include moving expenses and corresponding taxes.
* Compensation for the waiting period for the time difference between the valuation date and the estimated payment date.
* Loss of the remaining land, which is the decline in the value of land as a result of retrieval of most of the ground plane. If the remaining of the land can no longer function as intended, it can be calculated over the entire land value.
* Physical damages, if parts of the building were cut off as a result of land acquisition and costly repairs have to be carried out to restore functionality.


####  Valuation Issues

In practice, coordination among the land office, the agency needing land, and the appraiser should flow smoothly to achieve the expected results of the implementation stage, which are the compensation payments and the land release to the land institution (MASP/NLA).  A report of an appraiser involved in the implementation stage with the land office identified typical problems during this stage. 

* Data of the Asset. The data are either not ready on time, incomplete, still need to be corrected even after the valuation process, or inconsistent with the real conditions. Correction of data takes time, the process for doing so is complex and requires a re-inspection by BPN and other government officers. The mapping of an area may also not fully describe the condition of each land plot, but rather only identify the land plots to be acquired. This is misleading to the valuation as the condition of the area will affect the valuation result.  
* Date of Valuation (the date of issuance of location confirmation). In some cases, the date is not confirmed. In other cases, the location confirmation is issued long before the appointment of the appraiser, and so the valuation is out of date and may be significantly different from current market conditions. Such a situation affects the acceptability of the compensation value. There should be a provision allowing the re-issuance of the Notice of Location Decision.
* Time Frame of the Valuation Process. According to the regulation, the maximum time frame for the valuation process is 30 days, but in cases with a large land area with many parcels of land it is very difficult to meet the deadline. The deadline will only be reasonable if all data required are available.
* Payment Schedule. The time lag between valuation date and payment of the compensation is one of the items calculated as nonphysical loss. The monetary value of that time lag is based on government bond rate or fixed deposit rate of state banks. Payment delays typically occur due to: (i) landowners who disagree with the compensation value; (ii) landowners who disagree with the data of the asset provided by the land office; and (iii) the funds available are insufficient to pay all the compensation because the budget allocation for compensation is too small.
* Socialization of Value. There are cases where landowners are provoked by community leaders to try to get higher compensation although the valuation has been done properly. Communication with community leaders is very critical to ensuring acceptability of the compensation value.
* Property Market after Land Acquisition. This refers to an abnormal market caused by a very high demand for properties, which significantly boosts the property price. Because of the increase in property price, the compensation received by a landowner would not suffice to purchase a similar property. The valuation standard did not mention any premium regarding price changes. Most appraisers do not consider this condition in their valuation, although some consider this based on their understanding of principles of welfare in accordance with Law 2 of 2012. The valuation standard should clearly include the price changes to be considered in the compensation valuation.
* Remaining Land. Data from MASP/NLA are supposedly not only for the land that will be acquired but also the remaining land area that cannot be utilized since this will also be compensated. However, appraisers usually do not have information about the parcel includes the remaining land area.
* Right-of-Way Compensation. The compensation for 15% of the market value for land for transmission line project will only be applicable for agricultural land used for farming. In plantations with perennial crops, there may be total loss, because the owners can no longer utilize the land since cultivating plants that are more than 6 meters high will not be allowed. In such case, loss of trees or plants within the right-of-way has to be compensated. The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation 38 of 2013 defined the formula for compensation, which is 15% of the market value for land and building and 100% of the market value for plants.

The MASP/NLA Team. One issue is the limited personnel that conduct land surveys and measurements, which delays the implementation stage so that acquisition cannot be completed within the time limit. Meanwhile, the awareness and understanding of the BPN Team of the importance of data and the impact of data in valuation also needs to be upgraded. Communication between the Appraiser and BPN Team is very important for the success of this process. 

Availability and Capacity of Independent Appraisers. All appraisers in Indonesia have to be members of MAPPI. In 2015, there were a MAPPI had more than 6,000 members, which can be considered as the number of total appraisers in Indonesia. The membership has almost doubled since 2012 when Law 2 of 2012 was approved.

The increase in the number of MAPPI members may have been due to an increased interest in becoming appraisers. Appraisers Courses organized by MAPPI have become very much in demand, so much so that there is even a waiting list for it. In addition, many government institutions have submitted requests for valuation trainings.

Although the number of appraisers has increased significantly, the ratio of appraisers to the general population is very small. Indonesia has 24 appraisers per 1 million people. In comparison, Malaysia has around 45 appraisers per 1 million people, while Singapore has over 120.  The problem is not only the quantity of appraisers but also in their geographical distribution.  Appraisers are more concentrated in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, and Tangerang (Jabodetabek), which as a combined area accounts for more than 80% of the total appraisers in Indonesia.

Valuation of compensation is considered to be a new subject for Indonesian appraisers. MAPPI publishes the standards for valuation and compensation and also conducts training and dissemination of the new standards. Over 500 members have been trained in this new standard.

For land acquisition less than 5 ha, the land acquisition can be done directly between the agency needing the land and land rights holders through purchase or exchange or other means as agreed by both parties. However, such land acquisition can be done also using procedures set in the land acquisition law. If using the land acquisition law, the appraisers will value the land in accordance with the law with a greater value than the value of direct purchasing that refers to the market rate. The gap of the land values has previously led to allegations of corruption. The government auditor (Bapan Pemeriksa Keuangan – BPK) is of the view that land valuation for land acquisition less than 5 hectares should refer to the market rate, while the valuation result by appraisers is higher than the market rate.     

Submission of the Result Stage. The provincial land office (or the district one if delegated) is responsible for the submission of the result of valuation. The output of this stage is the handover of the land to the agency that needs it by the land office. The main activities in the stage are the development of the minutes of the meeting (Berita Acara) and the Land Certificate Application. 

Monitoring and Evaluation. Based on Law 2 of 2012, the land office is responsible for monitoring the land acquisition process. Monitoring in this case only covers the land acquisition process including implementation and the submission of the land acquisition result to the agency that needs the land. The scope of the monitoring does not include the land acquisition impacts to the affected persons or entitled parties.  The law does not require disclosure of the land acquisition monitoring report.
