Slight modifications were made to the terminology and definitions associated with the notion of “cultural heritage” in line with changing international standards.  The concept of cultural heritage under the new law explicitly includes not only heritage objects and artifacts, but also buildings, structures and sites of heritage value—both as encountered on land and under water.  In addition to recognizing that both man-made objects and natural objects can have heritage value, Law No. 11, 2010, extends recognition to the heritage value of landscapes. Law No. 11, 2010, further extends the definitional scope of the concept of “valuable” cultural heritage to include those artifacts that of significance to Indonesian history, science, education, religion, and / or cultural practices. 

Protection of cultural heritage resources under Law No. 11, 2010, applies not only to data recovery, but rather interprets protection in a broader sense of contributing to the development and utilization of cultural heritage as a means of protecting and preserving heritage resources. Additionally, discovery of suspected objects of if cultural heritage value must also be reported to a competent authority. Exploration for the purposes of discovering cultural artifacts remains contingent upon government permission and must taking into account the rights of ownership and/control of any resources discovered. Preservation efforts must involve feasibility studies that give consideration to the possibility of avoid damage to sensitive areas and must be supported by documentation.  Protection may be accomplished through proper zoning.  Monitoring of cultural heritage preservation plans is understood as critical.

Each person has the right to take advantage of the benefits of cultural heritage for the sake of religion, social, education, science, technology, culture, and tourism. It is required that any person in possession of cultural heritage objects must register them with the relevant government authorities; any cultural materials not registered may be confiscated by the government.  At the time of listing/registration, the cultural value of the heritage object will be assessed.  While primary control and ownership in heritage resources remains under the ultimate authority of the Indonesian state, the hereditary rights of indigenous people to use, control, and own artifacts of cultural heritage value is recognized—so long as the social functions of such do not conflict with legally-defined limitations.

Criminal provisions can be imposed on any of the following actions:

* transfer of ownership of cultural heritage
* failure to report the discovery of cultural heritage
* non-sanctioned exploration with the intention of discovering cultural heritage
* intentional efforts to prevent, hinder, or frustrate cultural heritage preservation efforts
* intentionally damaging cultural heritage
* stealing CB
* moving / relocating cultural heritage resources without special permission
* separating cultural heritage resources from their original contexts
* taking cultural heritage out of its country of origin without a license
* altering the functioning of a heritage site or landscape 
* illicit reproduction of cultural heritage artefacts 

Criminal acts committed by legal entity, including incorporated and / or business entities, shall be prosecuted, including by prosecuting the party who gave the order to commit criminal acts.
